# Stage the fabric ggml for the standalone parakeet build. Idempotent.
#
# The shared ggml of the QVAC speech stack is the ggml/ tree of
# qvac-fabric-llm.cpp (the same ggml the LLM stack ships; published to vcpkg
# as the qvac-fabric port). Backend filename-prefix loading, non-Adreno OpenCL
# support and the OpenCL program-binary cache are commits in that tree, so no
# local patches are applied here.
#
# GGML_REF is the single source of truth for which commit parakeet builds
# against; keep it equal to GGML_REF in .github/workflows/parakeet-ci.yml.
