// Memory-fit preflight: project whether a Parakeet GGUF fits the device
// memory available right now, without reading any weight data.
//
// The fitter opens the GGUF metadata-only (`no_alloc`), wires the model's
// tensor handles exactly as a real load would, and then *measures* the
// peak-resident allocation set of one offline transcribe (or diarize) on a
// fresh Engine -- the weight buffers (including the CPU-repack extra buffers
// on CPU runs), every encoder compute graph the runtime's graph cache will
// hold at once (a windowed long-form pass keeps up to three window graphs
// resident, not one), and the decoder-side state and fixed-shape graphs --
// using ggml's size-only allocator APIs. Nothing is allocated on the device
// and no graph is executed, so a fit call is cheap (milliseconds + one
// metadata read) and safe to run before committing to a full Engine load.
//
// Scope: the projection covers the offline paths. Streaming sessions for the
// legacy families (CTC/RNN-T/TDT/EOU) build smaller per-chunk graphs but
// rotate through the same 3-slot graph cache with session-dependent keys, so
// the offline projection is a good guide but not a proven upper bound for
// every streaming configuration. Nemotron is the exception: its native
// cache-aware streaming path is modelled explicitly -- the projection covers
// one offline transcribe (including the full-length locale-prompt projection
// graph, which scales with audio_seconds because the prompt conditioning runs
// over the whole stitched encoder output, not per window) PLUS one live
// streaming session at the FitOptions::nemotron_chunk_ms operating point (its
// step graph, per-chunk pre-encode graph, and host-resident caches).
//
// Status semantics follow the SDK's @qvac/model-fit contract:
//   Success -- a projection was made and it fits (result.fits == true).
//   Failure -- a projection was made and it does NOT fit. This is a valid
//              answer, not an error.
//   Error   -- no projection could be made (unreadable model, no backend
//              device registered, measurement failure). An empty device
//              registry is always Error, never Success: a projection made
//              against a machine the fitter cannot see is worse than none.
