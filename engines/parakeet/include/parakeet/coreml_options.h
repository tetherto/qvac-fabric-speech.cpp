// Core ML options for the Parakeet engine (PLAN §2.12, Appendix B.6).
//
// Every field is unset by default. The engine resolves them once, at
// construction, in this order per field: the explicit field, then the
// per-engine environment variable (PARAKEET_COREML_STRICT -> use = require;
// PARAKEET_COREML_COMPUTE_UNITS), then QVAC_COREML_CACHE_DIR (cache
// directory only), then the default. PARAKEET_COREML_DISABLE forces
// use = off and overrides everything.
//
// Defaults: use automatic, generate background, wait none on macOS and call on
// iOS, prewarm predicted, no cache directory (no generation, no warm hints),
// the stage's own compute units, strict waits unbounded, no memory budget.
//
// Builds without PARAKEET_COREML accept and ignore these options.
