# audiogen engine: tests and parity

Part of the [audiogen engine documentation](../README.md).

## Tests and parity

```sh
cmake -S engines/audiogen -B build/audiogen -DAUDIOGEN_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/ggml-install
cmake --build build/audiogen -j
ctest --test-dir build/audiogen
```

ACE-Step model-free tests are split into `test-acestep-units` (math and
sampling), `test-acestep-tokenizer`, `test-acestep-backends`,
`test-acestep-loading`, `test-acestep-quantization`, `test-acestep-audio`, and
`test-acestep-generation` (request policies and editing). Each suite has its
own process and assertion counters. Run one domain with `ctest -R`.

`test-acestep-units`, `test-acestep-converter`, `test-minimax-units`,
`test-minimax-converter`, `test-minimax-quant-audit`, and
`test-minimax-dump-compare` cover weight-free CPU logic and need no GGUFs.
ACE-Step coverage includes the BPE tokenizer (UTF-8 decode, merges, byte
fallback, decode round-trip) on a hand-built vocabulary. MiniMax coverage
includes metadata compatibility, model-pair selection, Unicode token classes,
frame validation, prompt assembly and the request-utils caption/lyrics
cleanup helpers, unconditional masking, deterministic noise, flow scheduling,
condition length, window stitching, sampler edge cases, and converter output
transactions. `test-minimax-fit` writes a tiny MiniMax pair and checks the
memory-fit preflight against the buffers a real load and graph allocation of
that pair produce, byte for byte, along with its workload limits, rejections
and the weightless-GGUF case. Set `AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_MODELS_DIR` to a
directory containing the MiniMax GGUF pair to run `test-minimax-integration`,
which covers model loading, generation output, progress, and cancellation, and
`test-minimax-fit-models`, which repeats the preflight parity check on the real
pair on the device `MM3_DEVICE` selects.
`test-minimax-tokenizer` loads a synthetic GGUF vocabulary and checks exact
IDs for BPE merges, byte fallback, Unicode, longest special-token matching,
empty inputs, and missing metadata. `test-minimax-converter-roundtrip` converts
a tiny safetensors conditioner and reads its GGUF back; serialization checks
cover F16, Q8_0, protected F32, overflow, and weight-norm folding. These real
conversion cases require `numpy` and `gguf`.

MiniMax integration distinguishes callback cancellation from explicit
`cancel()` and cross-thread cancellation. `MM3_DEVICE=gpu` requires successful
GPU execution; a missing GPU fails the test. `auto` can fall back to CPU.
The Q4 quality run requires `AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_Q4_MODELS_DIR` to resolve to
Q4_K_M or Q4_K_S; a mixed directory selecting Q8 or F16 fails.

On a Metal build, `ctest --test-dir build/audiogen -R
test-minimax-metal-ops` runs the model-free CPU/Metal condition and vocoder
parity regression. It skips with return code 77 either when Metal is
unavailable or when the Metal device cannot run `MUL_MAT` — both parity graphs
are matmul-based, and ggml gates `GGML_OP_MUL_MAT` on simdgroup reduction
(`MTLGPUFamilyApple7`+), which virtualized GPUs such as the ones on hosted macOS
CI runners do not report. Meaningful parity coverage therefore needs a
non-virtualized Apple GPU, which is why the audiogen CI macOS lane runs on the
self-hosted `qvac-macos26-arm64-gpu` runner and fails rather than passes if the
test skips there.
`test-acestep-integration` requires `AUDIOGEN_TEST_MODELS_DIR` with the four
ACE-Step GGUFs described in [model setup](pipeline.md#model-setup). From the
repository root, run the model-backed test against a standalone build:

```sh
AUDIOGEN_TEST_MODELS_DIR=/path/to/acestep \
ctest --test-dir build/audiogen -R '^test-acestep-integration$' --output-on-failure
```

The default reference uses CPU. Set `AUDIOGEN_TEST_GPU=1` to request GPU
placement; this variable uses presence semantics, so unset it for CPU coverage.
Set `AUDIOGEN_TEST_BASE_MODELS_DIR=/path/to/acestep-base` as well to exercise
optional base-model lego coverage. The primary fixture being unset skips the
test with return code 77; omitting the base fixture skips only that optional
coverage. A successful model-free test run does not establish generation parity.
For multi-config builds, add `-C Release` to `ctest`.

`test-minimax-conditioner-layout` compares tiled, strided Core ML IO with an
independent full convolution, including one-frame inputs and boundaries at
149, 150, 151, 299, 300 and 301 frames. With `AUDIOGEN_COREML=ON`, the
model-backed `test-minimax-coreml-conditioner` compares the original native
conditioner against CPU + ANE with recorded AR hiddens. It checks finite
outputs, identical resampled lengths, relative RMS error <= 0.002 and cosine
>= 0.9999. Set `AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_SYNTH` to the F16 synth GGUF,
`AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_COREML_CONDITIONER` to the compiled sidecar and
`AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_HIDDENS` to `frame-hiddens.f32` from `mm3-replay`.
`AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_DEVICE=gpu` selects the native GPU reference; the
test otherwise uses CPU. Missing artifacts skip with return code 77.

`test-audiogen-comparison-lib` runs the engine-comparison harness's own
`node:test` suites (`benchmarks/comparison/tests/`) on hosts with node,
so the harness's adapters, aggregation, and report logic stay verified.

Dumps are the tool for localising a backend divergence. Run the same prompt twice with `--dump-stages` (ACE-Step stages) or `--dump-iters` (MiniMax AR iterations), then compare:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/stage_cos.py` | per-stage cosine and rel_l2 between two dump directories; fails under a worst-stage cosine of 0.999, and also on a missing, truncated, or mismatched counterpart |
| `scripts/dequant_gguf.py` | rewrite a GGUF with every quantized tensor dequantized to F32, giving a ground-truth trajectory to compare a quantized run against |
| `scripts/compare_ar_dumps.py` | finite-subset cosine, argmax agreement, and top-8 overlap between two `--dump-iters` directories; gates on `--min-cosine` / `--min-argmax-agree` and fails a pair it could not actually compare |
| `scripts/audit_quant_types.py` | audit a quantized GGUF against the deny-list of tensors that must never be quantized, plus a per-type byte summary |

`stage_cos.py` and `dequant_gguf.py` need `numpy`; `dequant_gguf.py` and
`audit_quant_types.py` also need `gguf`. `compare_ar_dumps.py` uses `numpy`
when it is installed and falls back to an equivalent stdlib path when it is not.

## Required CI coverage

The self-hosted macOS lane builds with both Core ML flags enabled and runs
the VAE/conditioner exporters and all three MiniMax ANE Python suites with
the pinned dependencies in `engines/parakeet/scripts/requirements-coreml.txt`.
The ANE model and exporter suites are also registered with CTest; missing
Python dependencies produce an explicit skip (77). The ANE CLI suite is
registered when `AUDIOGEN_MINIMAX_COREML=ON` and executables are enabled.
Direct CI invocations fail if a required Python suite skips.

`test/ci-models.json` pins upstream revisions and SHA-256 hashes for the real
ACE-Step turbo/base stages, MiniMax checkpoint, and tokenizer. The staging
script verifies downloads, converts the MiniMax F16 pair with this checkout's
converter, and quantizes a separate Q4_K_M pair. Source downloads and outputs
persist under `$HOME/.cache/qvac-audiogen-ci-models`; converter, quantizer
header, or manifest changes invalidate the converted output cache. Allow at
least 80 GiB of disk for the fixtures and export artifacts.

CI runs ACE-Step integration (including the base lego lane), ACE-Step fit
parity, MiniMax CPU/GPU integration, MiniMax fit parity, and MiniMax F16/Q4
quality tests directly. A skipped binary exits 77 and fails the step. These
model runs are separate from the weight-free Metal operation parity test.
To stage the same fixtures locally, run from the repository root:

```sh
python3 engines/audiogen/scripts/prepare-ci-models.py \
  --cache-dir "$HOME/.cache/qvac-audiogen-ci-models" \
  --build-dir build/audiogen --output-env audiogen-models.env
```

The generated file contains the four fixture environment variables. Export
them before invoking the model-backed binaries. Set `MM3_DEVICE=gpu` to
require MiniMax GPU coverage and `AUDIOGEN_TEST_GPU=1` for ACE-Step GPU
placement. `test-acestep-xdna-generation` additionally requires XDNA0 and
enforces a PCM relative-L2 limit of 0.1 against CPU; it reports the measured
error before enforcing that bound.
