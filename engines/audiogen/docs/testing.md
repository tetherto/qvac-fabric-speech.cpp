# audiogen engine: tests and parity

Part of the [audiogen engine documentation](../README.md).

## Tests and parity

```sh
cmake -S engines/audiogen -B build/audiogen -DAUDIOGEN_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/ggml-install
cmake --build build/audiogen -j
ctest --test-dir build/audiogen
```

`test-acestep-units`, `test-acestep-converter`, `test-minimax-units`,
`test-minimax-converter`, `test-minimax-quant-audit`, and
`test-minimax-dump-compare` cover weight-free CPU logic and need no GGUFs.
ACE-Step coverage includes the BPE tokenizer (UTF-8 decode, merges, byte
fallback, decode round-trip) on a hand-built vocabulary. MiniMax coverage
includes metadata compatibility, model-pair selection, Unicode token classes,
frame validation, prompt assembly and the request-utils caption/lyrics
cleanup helpers, unconditional masking, deterministic noise, flow scheduling,
condition length, window stitching, sampler edge cases, and converter output
transactions. Set `AUDIOGEN_TEST_MINIMAX_MODELS_DIR` to a directory containing
the MiniMax GGUF pair to run `test-minimax-integration`, which covers model
loading, generation output, progress, and cancellation.
On a Metal build, `ctest --test-dir build/audiogen -R
test-minimax-metal-ops` runs the model-free CPU/Metal condition and vocoder
parity regression. It skips with return code 77 either when Metal is
unavailable or when the Metal device cannot run `MUL_MAT` — both parity graphs
are matmul-based, and ggml gates `GGML_OP_MUL_MAT` on simdgroup reduction
(`MTLGPUFamilyApple7`+), which virtualized GPUs such as the ones on hosted macOS
CI runners do not report. Meaningful parity coverage therefore needs a
non-virtualized Apple GPU, which is why the audiogen CI macOS lane runs on the
self-hosted `qvac-macos26-arm64-gpu` runner and fails rather than passes if the
test skips there.
`test-acestep-integration` exercises the ACE-Step public API when model paths
are supplied and otherwise reports a skipped test.
`test-audiogen-comparison-lib` runs the engine-comparison harness's own
`node:test` suites (`benchmarks/comparison/tests/`) on hosts with node,
so the harness's adapters, aggregation, and report logic stay verified.

Dumps are the tool for localising a backend divergence. Run the same prompt twice with `--dump-stages` (ACE-Step stages) or `--dump-iters` (MiniMax AR iterations), then compare:

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `scripts/stage_cos.py` | per-stage cosine and rel_l2 between two dump directories; fails under a worst-stage cosine of 0.999, and also on a missing, truncated, or mismatched counterpart |
| `scripts/dequant_gguf.py` | rewrite a GGUF with every quantized tensor dequantized to F32, giving a ground-truth trajectory to compare a quantized run against |
| `scripts/compare_ar_dumps.py` | finite-subset cosine, argmax agreement, and top-8 overlap between two `--dump-iters` directories; gates on `--min-cosine` / `--min-argmax-agree` and fails a pair it could not actually compare |
| `scripts/audit_quant_types.py` | audit a quantized GGUF against the deny-list of tensors that must never be quantized, plus a per-type byte summary |

`stage_cos.py` and `dequant_gguf.py` need `numpy`; `dequant_gguf.py` and
`audit_quant_types.py` also need `gguf`. `compare_ar_dumps.py` uses `numpy`
when it is installed and falls back to an equivalent stdlib path when it is not.

An informal local comparison against upstream `acestep.cpp` measured 0.98 to
0.99 end-to-end correlation on identical codes, and LM greedy decoding matched
upstream argmax. This is not reproducible benchmark evidence: the repository
does not pin the model set, upstream revision, command, correlation definition,
or result artifact. Use stage dumps and the scripts above for a recorded
comparison.
