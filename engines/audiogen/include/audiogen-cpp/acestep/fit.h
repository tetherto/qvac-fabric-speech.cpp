// Memory-fit preflight for the ACE-Step music-generation pipeline: project
// whether the four stage GGUFs + a generation workload fit the device memory
// available right now, without reading any weight data.
//
// The fitter resolves the same backends and per-stage placement a real
// Engine::create would (engine_backends.h / stage_placement.h), opens each
// stage GGUF metadata-only, wires its tensors exactly as the real loaders do,
// and prices every allocation through ggml's size-only APIs
// (ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors_from_buft_size for weight/KV buffers,
// ggml_gallocr_reserve_n_size for the real compute graphs at the workload's
// shapes). Nothing is allocated on any device
// and no graph is executed, so a fit call is cheap and safe to run before
// committing to a full Engine load.
//
// Residency: by default the engine time-shares the six stages (each is loaded
// right before its step and freed right after -- QVAC-22955), so the default
// projection is the PEAK PHASE: the largest per-pool footprint any single
// pipeline phase holds at once (the text/cond encoders overlap in one phase;
// everything else is one stage plus its compute). With ACESTEP_KEEP_STAGES (or
// FitOptions::keep_stages = 1) every stage stays resident and the projection
// is the SUM of all weights/KV/persistent graphs plus the largest ephemeral
// compute. The verdict per memory pool (the primary device, and host RAM for
// CPU-placed stages and host-side buffers) must hold for the fit to pass; on
// unified-memory devices the pools are one and the requirements add.
//
// Status semantics follow the SDK's @qvac/model-fit contract:
//   Success -- a projection was made and it fits (result.fits == true).
//   Failure -- a projection was made and it does NOT fit. This is a valid
//              answer, not an error.
//   Error   -- no projection could be made (unreadable model, no backend
//              device registered, measurement failure). An empty device
//              registry is always Error, never Success.
