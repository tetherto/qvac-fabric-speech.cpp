// Core ML options for tts-cpp engines that load sidecars through the shared
// Core ML runtime (today: the Chatterbox S3Gen encoder, CFM estimator and
// HiFT decoder).
//
// Every field is unset by default. An engine resolves them once, at
// construction (or once per call for direct pipeline callers), in this order
// per field: the explicit field, then the model family's environment variable
// (CHATTERBOX_COREML_STRICT -> use = require; CHATTERBOX_COREML_COMPUTE_UNITS),
// then QVAC_COREML_CACHE_DIR (cache directory only), then the default.
// CHATTERBOX_COREML_DISABLE forces use = off and overrides everything.
//
// Defaults: use automatic, generate background, wait none on macOS and call on
// iOS, prewarm predicted, no cache directory (no warm hints), the stage's own
// compute units, strict waits unbounded, no memory budget.
//
// Builds without TTS_CPP_COREML accept these options; an explicit invalid
// compute_units still throws there, and everything else is ignored.
