# tts-cpp

Native C++17/ggml speech synthesis, voice cloning, and post-synthesis
enhancement for the QVAC speech stack. There is no Python, PyTorch, or ONNX
Runtime dependency after models have been converted to GGUF.

This package exposes five public synthesis engine APIs covering six synthesis
families and eight model lines: Chatterbox Turbo, Chatterbox Multilingual,
Supertonic 1, 2, and 3, Parler-TTS, CosyVoice3, and Audio8. LavaSR is a
speech-enhancement pipeline, not a TTS synthesizer. The API count follows the
installed public headers under `include/tts-cpp/`; the two Chatterbox families
share one engine API, while the Supertonic generations share another.

This directory is the in-tree `engines/tts` package in
[`qvac-fabric-speech.cpp`](../../README.md). It consumes the system
`ggml-speech` package built from
[`qvac-ext-ggml@speech`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml/tree/speech).
The checkout intentionally starts without a local `ggml/` or `patches/`
overlay; a bundled build stages the speech fork under `engines/tts/ggml` via
`scripts/setup-ggml.sh` (pinned ref, idempotent on re-run). The standalone
[`chatterbox.cpp`](https://github.com/gianni-cor/chatterbox.cpp) repository is
the separate bundled-ggml development path.

engine, not every backend ggml can compile.

Chatterbox on CUDA depends on two ggml-cuda fixes carried by
[`qvac-ext-ggml@speech`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml/tree/speech).
Without the first (`im2col` / `pad` striding the grid Y and Z axes, which are
capped at 65535) a chunk past roughly ten seconds aborts the launch; Chatterbox
splits on sentences but readily emits a thirty-second chunk from ordinary
prose, so long-form input reaches it. Without the second (`conv_transpose_1d`
bounded to the kernel taps that reach each output) the HiFT vocoder is slower
on CUDA than on CPU and dominates the pipeline. With both, Chatterbox Turbo
runs at RTF 0.05 against 0.72 on CPU, and Multilingual at 0.08 against 3.23 --
CPU cannot keep up with real time on Multilingual and CUDA is comfortably
ahead of it.

What that row is based on: `test-s3gen` compares every S3Gen and HiFT stage to
the Python reference dump under an explicit per-stage tolerance and returns
non-zero when one is exceeded. It is registered per backend (`test-s3gen-cuda`,
`test-s3gen-vulkan`), each arm pinning its backend through
`TTS_CPP_GPU_BACKEND` and failing rather than falling back to the CPU.

T3 carries a weaker claim, and the shape of it matters. Its `t3-mtl-ref`
fixture cannot be regenerated -- the dump script pins no conditioning, so a
fresh dump disagrees with the C++ by about 4e-2 on CPU and CUDA alike -- so
there is no reference parity for T3 on any backend. Nor do CPU and GPU agree
token for token: T3 decodes autoregressively, so a single differing argmax
re-rolls the remainder and the two emit different counts for the same input
(55 against 56, 64 against 68, 63 against 69 on the three phrases the arm
uses). `test-chatterbox-parity-mtl-{cuda,vulkan}` therefore asserts what does
hold -- both backends produce audio, and within 1.35x of each other's duration,
which truncation, runaway generation and silent failure all break. T3 on CUDA
is gated at that strength and no more.

Parler on CUDA is covered by the same per-stage reference harnesses as the
other GPU backends, registered per backend as `test-parler-dac-{cuda,vulkan}`
and run with the full Parler suite pinned to each: 15/15 on CUDA and on
Vulkan against the mini-v1 fixtures. The Indic checkpoint remains hub-gated,
so its arm carries the mini/large result, as it always has. The DAC
range-equivalence check now states its real contract: bit-identity on the
CPU, and a measured tolerance on GPU backends, where a ranged decode near a
sequence edge builds a shorter graph than the full decode and a GEMM over a
different shape legitimately reduces in a different order (worst observed:
5.12e-4 on CUDA, under 1e-5 on Vulkan, against a 2e-3 bar; the window
arithmetic errors the check exists to catch are hop-scale).

Audio8 on CUDA required one ggml-cuda fix and a rethink of what its
harnesses measure. The fix: the transpose fast path of the CUDA copy kernel
ignores destination strides, so the V-cache append -- a transposed source
into a strided cache view -- corrupted attention from the first prefill step;
with the guarded kernel the LM's per-step numerics match the Vulkan-vs-CPU
baseline node for node. The rethink: Audio8's networks are expansive enough
that sub-ulp cross-backend rounding grows into large per-element differences,
and its rollouts are free-running, so one differing argmax re-rolls the rest.
The harnesses now gate on observables that are stable across backends -- a
teacher-forced LM trace with per-step numeric bounds and a token-agreement
rate (CPU exact, CUDA 96.9 percent, Vulkan 100), codec codes agreement with
energy-level latent bounds, and rollout audio sanity with correlation
reported for information -- with every bar measured on all three backends.
The same redesign is what fixed test-audio8-codec and test-audio8-lm-vulkan,
which had been failing on unmodified master since the speech ggml moved past
their calibration.

CosyVoice3 on CUDA is covered by the same per-stage reference harnesses as
its other GPU backends, each registered per backend --
`test-cosyvoice-{flow,llm,hift,conv1d,frontend,clone}-{cuda,vulkan}` and
`test-s3tokenizer-v3-{cuda,vulkan}[-q8_0]` -- so both desktop backends stay
pinned rather than whichever selection prefers: the full CosyVoice and
s3tokenizer suite passes 27/27 pinned to CUDA and to Vulkan. Greedy long-form
synthesis (67 s of audio, well past the launch-abort threshold the
grid-striding fix removed) produces the identical sample count (1617600) on
CUDA, Vulkan and the CPU -- each measured -- at roughly 12 s wall on either
GPU against 526 s on the CPU. The CUDA column here is engine-level validation; the consumer path --
the published `speech-cpp[cuda]` port and the addon behind it -- ships with
the registry bump that closes this model series, which is when that port and
the qvac workflows exercise it end to end.

Supertonic on CUDA rests on a backend-capability distinction the F16-weight
auto policy now probes: the conv-via-im2col lowerings put the weight in
mul_mat's second operand, and ggml-cuda (and ggml-cpu) accept an F16 weight as
the first operand while rejecting it as the second, where ggml-vulkan accepts
both. Materialising F16 weights on such a backend left the scheduler with a
node no backend claims and aborted the first synthesis. The auto policy
requires both orientations, so CUDA and any future backend in its position
keep F32 weights -- slower but correct, the same trade the policy already
makes on CPU and OpenCL -- while Vulkan and Metal keep the F16 roster. With
that in place all three Supertonic generations synthesize on CUDA at every
shipped tier (f32, f16, q8_0, q4_0), the direct and scheduler paths are
bit-identical per backend (`test-supertonic-sched-equivalence-{cuda,vulkan}`),
and CUDA matches the CPU's output length exactly on the reference sentences.

Where a build carries both CUDA and Vulkan, selection prefers CUDA on NVIDIA:
measured on one binary on an RTX 3090, Chatterbox Turbo is 8.6x faster on CUDA
than on that card's Vulkan adapter. Set `TTS_CPP_GPU_BACKEND` to `cuda`,
`vulkan`, `metal` or `opencl` to pin one for a test arm or a comparison; an
unrecognised value is rejected rather than silently dropping to the CPU.

Chatterbox Multilingual's native tokenizer covers `en, es, fr, de, it, pt, nl,
pl, tr, sv, da, fi, no, el, ms, sw, ar, ko`; `ja`, `he`, `ru`, `zh`, and `hi`
use external preprocessing. Japanese requires MeCab/IPAdic and Chinese requires
a Cangjie5 TSV.

### API, streaming, and CLI matrix

| Family | Installed header | Streaming API | CLI surface |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chatterbox | `<tts-cpp/chatterbox/engine.h>` | true incremental S3Gen/HiFT chunks | `tts-cli` batch and streaming |
| Supertonic 1/2/3 | `<tts-cpp/supertonic/engine.h>` | text-chunk pipeline streaming | `supertonic-cli` batch/streaming; `tts-cli` batch only and rejects streaming flags |
| Parler | `<tts-cpp/parler/engine.h>` | incremental callback via `stream_chunk_frames` | `parler-cli` and `tts-cli` batch only; neither exposes streaming |
| CosyVoice3 | `<tts-cpp/cosyvoice/engine.h>` | callback is post-hoc chunking after full generation | `cosyvoice-cli` |
| Audio8 | `<tts-cpp/audio8/engine.h>` | no | `audio8-cli` |
| LavaSR | `<tts-cpp/lavasr/{denoiser,enhancer}.h>` | block-oriented enhancement APIs | `lavasr-bench` |

`tts-cli` is intentionally a limited metadata dispatcher: it handles
Chatterbox, batch Supertonic, and a reduced Parler surface. Use the dedicated
CLIs for the complete Supertonic, Parler, CosyVoice3, and Audio8 options.

### Defaults that differ by surface

| Setting | `tts-cli` | Library engines and dedicated CLIs |
|---|---|---|
| Seed | `0` unless `--seed` is supplied | generally `42` |
| Threads | capped at 4 by default | Chatterbox, Supertonic, Parler, and Audio8 cap automatic selection at 4; CosyVoice stage behavior is not generalized here |
| Parler greedy | repaired to sampling with a warning because argmax does not terminate | same; use `seed` for reproducibility |
| Chatterbox streaming CFM | Turbo accepts 1 or 2 steps | Multilingual standard CFM requests below the model timestep count are floored to 10 |

## Chatterbox

End-to-end inference on a short sentence with voice cloning from an 11 s
reference wav (T3 + S3Gen + HiFT, warm runs, excludes model load):

**Turbo:**

| Backend                              | Wall      | `RTF`  | vs real-time |
|--------------------------------------|----------:|-------:|-------------:|
| Vulkan (CI · Linux x86-64, Q4_0)     |   410 ms  | 0.099  | **10.1×**    |
| Metal (Mac Studio M3 Ultra, Q4_0)    |   985 ms  | 0.16   | 6.4×         |
| CPU (CI · Linux x86-64, Q4_0)        | 5 841 ms  | 1.54   | 0.65×        |
| CPU (Mac Studio M3 Ultra, NEON)      | 7 568 ms  | 1.05   | 0.96×        |

> Rows are independent warm runs on different machines/backends, so **`RTF`** —
> not wall time — is the comparable metric; wall time tracks each run's own
> generated audio length. The Linux x86-64 rows are CI numbers (see the
> [Performance](#performance) section for the full CI table + provenance).

**Multilingual** (same Spanish prompt, seed 42, built-in voice):

| Backend                              | Wall      | `RTF` | vs real-time |
|--------------------------------------|----------:|------:|-------------:|
| **Metal (M3 Ultra, Q4_0, `--cfm-steps 7`)** | **1.05 s**| **0.30** | **3.3×**     |
| Metal (M3 Ultra, Q4_0)               |  **1.22 s** | 0.35  | 2.9×        |
| Metal (M3 Ultra, F16, `--cfm-steps 7`)| 1.16 s   |  0.32  | 3.2×        |
| Metal (M3 Ultra, F16)                |  1.41 s   |  0.38  | 2.6×        |
| **Metal (M4, Q4_0)**                 |  **3.0 s**| 1.37  | 0.73×        |
| Metal (M4, F16)                      |   4.0 s   | 1.65  | 0.61×        |
| CPU (M4, 4t NEON, Q4_0)              |  10.7 s²  | 4.32² | 0.23×        |
| CPU (M4, 4t NEON, F16)               |  17.1 s²  | 6.70² | 0.15×        |

The M3 Ultra rows reflect the §3.21 optimisation pass — CFG cond+uncond
batched into one Metal forward (B=2) on T3, the new `--cfm-steps N` knob
on the standard 10-step CFM (N=7 is the recommended quality knee, log-mel
cosine vs N=10 = **0.995**), and `ggml_swiglu_split` on the Llama MLP.
The M4 rows are kept for continuity with §3.19/§3.20.

² **CPU multilingual rows re-measured after restoring CFG on the
non-Metal CFM path.**  The previous numbers in this row (`6.0 s / 2.69`
and `7.8 s / 3.24`) were captured between Apr 23–May 4 while the
non-`use_b2` branch in the CFM step loop was silently running only the
conditional pass — i.e. half the CFM compute, no classifier-free
guidance steering on CPU/Vulkan/CUDA.  Fixed in commit `6d9b42b`; the
two rows above are now end-to-end re-measurements on the same M4 host
with CFG correctly applied (12 CFM steps × 2 forward calls).
S3Gen wall-time roughly doubled, RTF went up ~2×.  Metal rows are
unaffected (the `use_b2` branched path always carried the CFG combine).

See the [full benchmark](#performance) section below for the CI benchmark
table, or [`PROGRESS.md`](PROGRESS.md) for the full chronological
development journal — every numerical-parity stage and optimization pass
(T3 Flash Attention, KV-cache layout rework, Metal kernel patches,
CAMPPlus + VoiceEncoder + S3TokenizerV2 ported to ggml graphs, mel
extraction via STFT matmul, T3 Q4/Q5/Q8 quantization, the multilingual
Llama-520M port + CFG dual-cache (§3.19), and the shared S3Gen weight-
quantisation pass that ships in this repo (§3.20)).

## Public APIs

The installed CMake target is `tts-cpp::tts-cpp`. Persistent engine classes
load their model once and reuse it across synthesis calls:

| Namespace | Primary surface | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `tts_cpp::chatterbox` | `Engine::synthesize` | 24 kHz PCM by default; Turbo/Multilingual selected by GGUF metadata |
| `tts_cpp::supertonic` | `Engine::synthesize` | model-rate PCM, usually 44.1 kHz |
| `tts_cpp::parler` | `Engine::synthesize` | 44.1 kHz PCM conditioned by a description |
| `tts_cpp::cosyvoice` | `Engine::synthesize` | 24 kHz PCM |
| `tts_cpp::audio8` | `Engine::synthesize` | 44.1 kHz PCM, optionally cloned from `VoicePrompt` |
| `tts_cpp::lavasr` | `Denoiser` / `Enhancer` | enhanced PCM |

The public surface also includes Chatterbox's lower-level
`s3gen_synthesize_to_wav`, `s3gen_preload`, and `s3gen_unload`, plus
`tts_cpp_cli_main`. Symbols without `TTS_CPP_API`, including `detail`
namespaces used by tests, are private and hidden from shared-library consumers.

### Consumer integration

Downstream projects in the QVAC speech stack consume `tts-cpp` via
the matching `tts-cpp` vcpkg port (this in-tree subtree).  ggml comes
from the [`ggml-speech`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-registry-vcpkg)
sister port, which vendors the
[`qvac-ext-ggml/speech`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml/tree/speech)
branch with all Metal / OpenCL / Vulkan patches pre-applied.  Once
both ports are installed, integration on the consumer side is one
`find_package` call:

```cmake
find_package(tts-cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE tts-cpp::tts-cpp)
```

```cpp
#include <tts-cpp/chatterbox/engine.h>

tts_cpp::chatterbox::EngineOptions opts;
opts.t3_gguf_path    = "models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf";
opts.s3gen_gguf_path = "models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf";
opts.n_gpu_layers    = 99;
tts_cpp::chatterbox::Engine engine(opts);
auto result = engine.synthesize("Hello, world.");
// result.pcm is 24 kHz mono float32 PCM ready to be written as wav.
```

The supertonic test/bench harnesses link against `tts-cpp` directly
and use detail-namespaced symbols outside the `TTS_CPP_API` public
surface, so the integrated port keeps the default
`TTS_CPP_BUILD_SHARED=OFF` and `TTS_CPP_BUILD_TESTS=OFF`.  See
[**Useful CMake options**](#useful-cmake-options) below for the full
flag table. The streaming text chunker (`split_for_streaming`:
sentence/clause/whitespace boundary priority, first-chunk latency knob,
tiny-tail merge, CJK sentence ends) is pinned model-free by
`test-supertonic-chunker`.

`tts-cli` handles both Chatterbox variants via `chatterbox.variant` metadata.
There is no separate `chatterbox` executable target. Supertonic and Parler
GGUFs are autodetected from their architecture metadata.

| LavaSR | optional UL-UNAS denoiser → Vocos bandwidth-extension enhancer |

## Voice conditioning (cross-engine)

`emotion` and `pace` mean the same thing on every engine that has them, and
the vocabulary lives in exactly one place: `include/tts-cpp/voice_controls.h`.
Each engine declares the subset it supports; an unsupported value throws
naming that engine and listing its set, so nothing is silently degraded and no
untested prompt is ever invented.

| | emotion | pace | exact rate knob |
|---|---|---|---|
| Parler-TTS | all 12 | slow / moderate / fast | — |
| CosyVoice3 | anger, happy, neutral, sad | slow / moderate / fast | — |
| Supertonic | not supported | slow / moderate / fast | `speed` (multiplier) |
| Chatterbox | not supported | not supported | `speed` (multiplier) |
| Audio8 | not supported | not supported | — |

The 12 canonical emotions: command, anger, narration, conversation, disgust,
fear, happy, neutral, proper noun, news, sad, surprise.  Case-insensitive.
Note `anger`, not `angry` — the latter is deliberately rejected.

Every CLI accepts `--emotion` / `--pace`, plus `--list-emotions` /
`--list-paces` to print what the engine in question actually supports.
`tts-cli` routes several model families, so it lists one line per family.

Three per-engine properties worth knowing:

- **Parler** renders both into the training-caption text, so `pace` shows up
  verbatim in the description ("at a moderate pace").
- **CosyVoice3** is trained on one instruction per synthesis, so engaging two
  controls throws rather than silently picking a winner.  All four emotions,
  `neutral` included, are instructions and therefore conflict with `pace` or
  a raw `instruct`.  `pace=moderate` is the one value that engages nothing:
  CosyVoice3 has no middle-pace instruction to send, so it falls back to the
  plain zero-shot path — which keeps the prompt speech tokens and places the
  transcript after `<|endofprompt|>`, where an instruction would drop them and
  sit before it.
- **Supertonic** maps the step onto its duration multiplier *relative to the
  GGUF's own `default_speed`*, so `pace=moderate` is bit-identical to setting
  nothing.  `pace` and `speed` together throw — pick one.
- **Audio8** is zero-shot cloning driven by a reference waveform and has no
  named conditioning at all; its only prosody knobs are the sampling
  parameters.

## Parler-TTS

Description-conditioned TTS: the transcript (`--text`) is spoken in a voice
controlled by a natural-language description (`--description`).  Supports
`parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1`, `parler-tts/parler-tts-large-v1` and
`ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts` (21 languages incl. Hindi/Gujarati);
model differences are pure GGUF metadata (`parler.*` keys), no code
branching.  Pipeline: Flan-T5 encoder (description → cross-attention K/V,
precomputed once and cached per description) → delay-pattern decoder LM
(9 DAC codebooks, MusicGen-style stagger, HF-faithful EOS gating) → DAC
codec decode → 44.1 kHz mono PCM.  Validated backends are CPU, Metal,
Vulkan, and OpenCL (Adreno): the GPU path (F16 flash attention, fused QKV +
stacked LM heads, DAC upsampling as phase matmuls) is gated on that
allowlist in `src/parler/gguf.cpp`, and any other GPU backend is released at
load and replaced by CPU rather than run unvalidated.  The graph dispatch
uses the shared `sched_dispatch` dual path like the other engines.

Indic-class checkpoints ship a second, SentencePiece-BPE **prompt**
tokenizer (90k vocab covering the Indic scripts, byte fallback) alongside
the Flan-T5 description tokenizer; the converter embeds both
(`parler.prompt_tokenizer.*` keys) and the engine routes prompts through
the BPE tokenizer when present.  mini/large GGUFs are unaffected (one
shared tokenizer, byte-identical output).  The language is auto-detected
from the prompt script; descriptions stay English (name a recommended
voice — e.g. Rohit for Hindi, Yash for Gujarati — for stable speakers).

```sh
# convert (single GGUF: T5 + decoder + DAC + tokenizer; ~3.4 GB f32)
python3 scripts/parler/convert-to-gguf.py \
    --model-id parler-tts/parler-tts-mini-v1 --dtype f32 \
    --out models/parler-mini-v1-f32.gguf

# synthesize (also autodetected by tts-cli via parler.arch + --description)
./build/parler-cli --model models/parler-mini-v1-f32.gguf \
    --text "Hey, how are you doing today?" \
    --description "A female speaker with a calm, clear voice, close up." \
    --out out.wav
```

The indic checkpoint is gated on HF (`gated: auto` — any account gets
instant access); pass a downloaded snapshot directory as `--model-id`
with `--reference-repo ai4bharat/indic-parler-tts` for provenance.

Instead of writing a full `--description`, the voice can be configured
through template flags (`build_description()` in
`<tts-cpp/parler/description.h>` — the same renderer the downstream addon
uses).  The rendered text follows the models' training-caption phrasing,
and every flag has a working default — with no flags at all the engine
uses the models' recommended fallback caption ("The speaker speaks
naturally. The recording is very high quality with no background noise."):

| flag | values (default first) | rendered as |
|---|---|---|
| `--voice` | free name, e.g. Rohit, Laura | sentence subject |
| `--emotion` | one of the 12 below | tone clause + "The intended style is …" |
| `--pitch` | unset, low, moderate, high | "with a low pitch" |
| `--pace` | unset, slow, moderate, fast | "speaks slowly" / "at a fast pace" |
| `--expressivity` | unset, monotone, slightly expressive, expressive | "in an expressive manner" |
| `--noise` | clear, noisy | "with no/noticeable background noise" |
| `--reverb` | close, distant | "distant-sounding" (close is implied) |
| `--quality` | very high, high, basic | "The recording is … quality" |

Emotions come from the shared vocabulary in [Voice conditioning](#voice-conditioning-cross-engine)
— the 12 speaking styles in the indic training set, case-insensitive and
validated.  Each renders an in-distribution clause ("with an angry tone",
"delivering the news", "perfect for narration") plus the trailing style
anchor sentence the training captions used.  The indic card lists 10 officially emotion-tested
languages (Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi,
Sanskrit, Nepali, Tamil); elsewhere — including Hindi/Gujarati and the
mini/large English checkpoints — emotion conditioning exists but is
best-effort: validate by ear.  `--description` and the template flags are
mutually exclusive (the CLI errors out rather than silently preferring
one).

`--dtype f16` (~2.5 GB) casts only the decoder matmul weights and
embeddings; the T5 encoder stays f32 (Flan-T5 activations overflow the
f16 range — the well-known T5 fp16 trap), as do norms, biases, snake
alphas, the positional table and all DAC tensors.

Quantized recipes (mini sizes; argmax agreement vs the f32 fixtures over a
200-step teacher-forced trace, f16 scoring 99.6%):

| `--dtype` | size | agree | bulk / tables / heads / T5 |
|---|---|---|---|
| `q8_0` | ~1.16 GB | 98.1% | q8_0 / f16 / f16 / q8_0 |
| `q6_k` | ~0.98 GB | 94.9% | q6_K / q6_K / f16 / q8_0 |

Sub-q6 tiers measured well below this quality floor (q5_0 90.4%, q4_k_m
83.1% on mini; 70.0% / 65.9% on large) and are deliberately not shipped —
reproduce them via `--recipe` if ever needed.  The recipes transfer to
the indic checkpoint unchanged (its own 200-step fixtures: f16 99.6%,
q8_0 98.3%; f32 scores 100%).  All recipes keep the f32
set above untouched and the T5 matmuls at q8_0 (quantized dot products
re-quantize activations per block, so the f16 trap does not apply — T5
must never go f16).  The 9 LM heads never drop below q8_0 (6-bit heads
derail sampled decoding); both tiers lift heads (q8_0 also tables) to
f16 — the dominant quality lever found by grid search
(`scripts/parler/quant-grid.py`; per-tier override via `--recipe`, optional
activation-weighted quantization via `scripts/parler/compute-imatrix.py` +
`--imatrix`).  Non-trivial encodes go through the built ggml library
(`ggml_quantize_chunk` via ctypes; auto-located, or pass `--ggml-lib`), so
build tts-cpp first.  Quantized output diverges from the f32 parity
fixtures by construction — validate by ear;
`PARLER_TEST_REPORT_ONLY=1 ./build/test-parler-t5 MODEL.gguf REF_DIR` and
the corresponding `test-parler-decoder` invocation print stage metrics without
enforcing the f32 tolerance bars.

Digits in the prompt are expanded to English words before tokenization
("12" → "twelve"): parler-v1 ships no text front-end and voices raw digits
badly, so this deliberately diverges from stock HF.  English cardinals
(incl. thousands separators), decimals and ordinals are covered; times,
currency and units are not.  Opt out with `--no-normalize-numbers`
(`EngineOptions::normalize_numbers = false`); the description is never
rewritten.  On indic-class models, ASCII digit runs whose nearest letter
context is an Indic script are instead transliterated to that script's
native digits ("कमरा 12" → "कमरा १२"; all 13 digit-bearing scripts of the
21 languages covered); Latin-context runs still become English words, and
native numerals always pass through untouched.  Best effort by design:
the model only voices native numerals for scripts whose numerals were
frequent in its training text (Devanagari yes; e.g. Gujarati no —
verified by ear); full per-language number-words belong upstream where
the prompt language is known.

Verification: `ctest -R test-parler` runs tokenizer/T5/decoder/delay/DAC/
e2e parity against `.npy` fixtures produced by
`scripts/parler/dump-reference.py` (HF PyTorch reference, greedy).
`test-parler-gguf-load` needs no fixtures: it synthesizes tiny GGUFs and
asserts the loader fails closed on truncated files, missing metadata, and
wrong-typed metadata.  The
greedy token trace matches HF exactly; the DAC waveform matches at
>120 dB SNR. Default decoding is sampled (temperature 1.0, top-k 50, from
`generation_config.json`). End-user `--greedy` and `top_k=1` requests are
repaired to sampling with a warning because argmax does not terminate for this
architecture; use `--seed` for reproducibility. Greedy is retained only inside
the bounded parity harness.

Streaming is available through the `parler::Engine` callback API using
`stream_chunk_frames` and `stream_first_chunk_frames`. Neither `parler-cli` nor
the limited `tts-cli` Parler route exposes those controls.

## Supertonic GGUF

The tree also contains a Supertonic path.  It is
model-specific: the official Supertone ONNX files and assets are converted
into one GGUF, then a ggml C++ runtime runs the known Supertonic stages on
CPU or, with `--n-gpu-layers > 0`, on Metal (Apple), Vulkan, OpenCL (Adreno),
or CUDA when that backend is compiled in.  Metal is the fastest backend
measured so far: on an Apple M5 (10-core GPU) Supertonic 3 `q8_0` renders a
3.1 s / 9.6 s / 16.3 s utterance in `32.8 / 55.4 / 77.8 ms` (`RTF 0.011 /
0.006 / 0.005`, medians of 20 warm runs), 2.2x / 2.0x / 2.1x faster than the
Metal path before the one-graph stages and kernel fusions below; the `f16`
GGUF lands within 1 ms of `q8_0`.  Supertonic 2 `q8_0` measured `91.4 ms`
total on an M2 (see [`PROGRESS_SUPERTONIC.md`](PROGRESS_SUPERTONIC.md)).

There are three related upstream bundles:

- `Supertone/supertonic` is the stable English bundle.  It should be used for
  English and does **not** wrap text in language tags.
- `Supertone/supertonic-2` is the multilingual bundle.  It should use the
  open/close language-tag path (`<lang>...</lang>`).  The older prefix-only
  form (`<lang>... `) can make English prompts stutter.
- `Supertone/supertonic-3` advertises 31 languages plus `na` for unknown source
  language and uses the open/close language-tag path.

Current status:

- `scripts/dump-supertonic-reference.py` dumps ONNX Runtime reference tensors;
  see [Fixtures and static validation](#fixtures-and-static-validation) for
  the exact v2/v3 artifact layout.
- `scripts/setup-supertonic2.sh` downloads the official Hugging Face bundle
  through `huggingface_hub` and writes the local GGUF.
- `scripts/convert-supertonic2-to-gguf.py` writes `models/supertonic.gguf`
  (English) or `models/supertonic2.gguf` (multilingual), depending on flags.
  When `--onnx-dir` is omitted, it downloads the selected repo just like the
  Chatterbox converters.
- `build/tts-cli` autodetects Supertonic GGUFs from `supertonic.arch` and can
  synthesize a 44.1 kHz wav on CPU or GPU (`--n-gpu-layers`, with
  `--vulkan-device` to pick an adapter), but rejects Supertonic streaming
  flags. `build/supertonic-cli` is the full batch/streaming surface.
- All five stages pass numerical parity against the ONNX reference
  (preprocess, duration, text encoder, vector estimator, vocoder), and the
  full pipeline (`test-supertonic-pipeline`) reproduces the ONNX reference
  waveform when fed the same initial noise tensor.
- The production path is GGML-backed for duration, text encoder, vector
  estimator, and vocoder.  Text relative-position self-attention and FFN blocks
  are expressed with stock GGML ops, and the speech-prompted text attention /
  vector attention blocks use `ggml_flash_attn_ext` where the math allows it.
- Vector attention uses strided Q/K/V GGML views where the time-channel layout
  permits it.  The vector runtime also keeps persistent graph/allocr caches for
  attention, ConvNeXt group, and tail islands, plus fused ConvNeXt boundary /
  tail update graphs and portable custom CPU kernels for pointwise Conv1D,
  depthwise Conv1D, row-wise layer norm, dense time matmul, and fused
  bias/GELU/residual elementwise work.
- The vocoder keeps a persistent GGML graph cache and uses portable
  BLAS/Accelerate-backed causal Conv1D custom ops for the hot projection paths.
  BLAS worker threads are capped by default to avoid nested oversubscription
  under GGML task-level threading.
- Off the CPU backend the duration encoder, the text encoder, the whole CFM
  loop (every step, classifier-free guidance batched along time) and the
  vocoder each run as one graph compute; the relative-position bias is a
  strided view over a padded tensor instead of a mask chain.  ggml-metal fuses
  the Supertonic depthwise convolution into the following channel layer norm
  and the mat-mat epilogues (bias, bias + residual, bias + GELU, gamma +
  residual) into its mat-mat kernels.  `SUPERTONIC_DISABLE_TEXT_ONE_GRAPH=1`,
  `SUPERTONIC_DISABLE_DURATION_ONE_GRAPH=1`, `GGML_METAL_FUSION_MM_EPILOGUE_DISABLE=1`
  and `GGML_METAL_FUSION_DW_LN_DISABLE=1` restore the previous paths for A/B runs.
- `SUPERTONIC_VECTOR_PROFILE=1` and `SUPERTONIC_TEXT_PROFILE=1` print
  per-island timings for tuning graph boundaries.  Current text profiling shows
  stock-op relpos is ~0.7-0.8 ms/layer on the quick prompt, so a fused relpos
  op is deferred until backend profiling proves it necessary.
- CPU thread count is controlled by `--threads`; the default caps at 4 threads
  because the current small-graph Supertonic path regresses when oversubscribed.
- Current CPU benchmark artifacts live in
  `artifacts/supertonic-thread-matrix/`.  The final matched matrix on this
  machine uses F1, 5 denoise steps, speed `1.05`, `runs=3`, `warmup=1`, and
  ONNX Runtime `CPUExecutionProvider` only.  GGML wins 10 of 12 matched
  thread/prompt comparisons.  The only end-to-end losses are quick English at
  4 threads (`157.7 ms` vs `148.8 ms`) and long English at 4 threads
  (`361.2 ms` vs `351.5 ms`).
- The current quick prompt 4-thread medians are `13.5 ms` text encoder,
  `96.3 ms` vector estimator, `43.6 ms` vocoder, and `157.7 ms` total
  (`RTF 0.050`).  Portuguese 4-thread now wins end to end (`234.3 ms` GGML vs
  `250.8 ms` ONNX), with GGML vocoder at `68.9 ms` vs ONNX `95.6 ms`.

Latest matched CPU matrix, median total milliseconds:

| Prompt | GGML 1t | GGML 2t | GGML 3t | GGML 4t | ONNX 1t | ONNX 2t | ONNX 3t | ONNX 4t |
|--------|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| quick English | 298.0 | 189.4 | 157.7 | 157.7 | 373.8 | 218.5 | 168.3 | 148.8 |
| longer English | 757.5 | 491.2 | 390.3 | 361.2 | 1103.0 | 580.6 | 555.7 | 351.5 |
| Portuguese smoke | 457.2 | 292.9 | 251.0 | 234.3 | 610.6 | 344.6 | 268.3 | 250.8 |

## CosyVoice3

CosyVoice3 runs a Qwen2.5 speech-token LM, DiT conditional-flow-matching
network, and CausalHiFT vocoder through `tts_cpp::cosyvoice::Engine`. The
validated backends are CPU, Metal (macOS / iOS), OpenCL (Adreno), and Vulkan
(Linux / Windows desktop); `n_gpu_layers > 0` selects the GPU path via the
engine's backend requirement and other GPU backends fall back to CPU. On
Android the requirement stays Metal-or-OpenCL, so Vulkan-only mobile GPUs
(e.g. Mali, Xclipse) keep declining to CPU rather than running unvalidated.
`--vulkan-device N` pins the Vulkan adapter on multi-GPU hosts (`-1`
auto-picks the discrete card with the most free VRAM).

Use `cosyvoice-cli` for end-to-end synthesis. The `cosyvoice-hift`,
`cosyvoice-flow`, and `cosyvoice-llm` executables isolate stages, and
`cosyvoice-bench` reports per-stage timing. The streaming callback currently
chunks PCM only after the full utterance has been generated, so it preserves
the callback shape but does not reduce first-audio latency.

```bash
./build/cosyvoice-cli --model-dir models/cosyvoice3-0.5b \
  --text "Hello from CosyVoice3." --out out.wav
```

### Convert

Everything the engine loads converts from the official
[Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B](https://huggingface.co/FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512)
checkpoint plus the 3D-Speaker CAM++ torch checkpoint;
`scripts/download-cosyvoice3-checkpoint.sh` fetches both (Hugging Face CLI:
`pip install -U huggingface_hub`). The LM/flow/HiFT converters need the
[Conversion tooling](#conversion-tooling) environment with `torch`; the
tokenizer converter additionally needs `pip install s3tokenizer` (or
`--s3tokenizer-repo` at a checkout of it).

```bash
scripts/download-cosyvoice3-checkpoint.sh --dir checkpoints/cosyvoice3

python3 scripts/convert-cosyvoice3-llm-to-gguf.py \
    --llm checkpoints/cosyvoice3/llm.pt \
    --outfile cosyvoice3-llm-f32.gguf --dtype f32
python3 scripts/convert-cosyvoice3-flow-to-gguf.py \
    --flow checkpoints/cosyvoice3/flow.pt \
    --config checkpoints/cosyvoice3/cosyvoice3.yaml \
    --outfile cosyvoice3-flow-f32.gguf --dtype f32
python3 scripts/convert-cosyvoice3-hift-to-gguf.py \
    --hift checkpoints/cosyvoice3/hift.pt \
    --outfile cosyvoice3-hift-f32.gguf --dtype f32

# voice-cloning add-on (required only when reference_audio is used)
python3 scripts/convert-s3tokenizer-v3-to-gguf.py \
    --onnx checkpoints/cosyvoice3/speech_tokenizer_v3.onnx \
    --out cosyvoice3-s3tok-f16.gguf --outtype f16
python3 scripts/convert-campplus-to-gguf.py \
    --ckpt checkpoints/cosyvoice3/campplus_cn_common.bin \
    --out cosyvoice3-campplus-f32.gguf
```

The LM converter also accepts `--dtype {f16,q8_0,q4_0}`; flow and HiFT accept
`f32`/`f16`.

The engine will not construct without a baked default voice (`voice.gguf`): it
packs the four prompt tensors of one reference utterance, computed on the
upstream PyTorch stack. The dump scripts load the upstream CosyVoice3 Python
model, so they need a full Hugging Face snapshot (including `campplus.onnx`
and the yaml/config set — the converter inputs fetched above are not enough)
plus a [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice) checkout with its
dependencies on `PYTHONPATH`:

```bash
hf download FunAudioLLM/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B-2512 \
    --local-dir checkpoints/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B

PYTHONPATH=CosyVoice:CosyVoice/third_party/Matcha-TTS \
python3 scripts/dump-cosyvoice3-reference.py \
    --model-dir checkpoints/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B \
    --prompt-audio CosyVoice/asset/zero_shot_prompt.wav \
    --prompt-text "希望你以后能够做的比我还好呦。" \
    --out-dir artifacts/cv3-ref
PYTHONPATH=CosyVoice:CosyVoice/third_party/Matcha-TTS \
python3 scripts/dump-cosyvoice3-llm-reference.py \
    --model-dir checkpoints/Fun-CosyVoice3-0.5B \
    --prompt-audio CosyVoice/asset/zero_shot_prompt.wav \
    --prompt-text "希望你以后能够做的比我还好呦。" \
    --out-dir artifacts/llm-ref

python3 scripts/bake-cosyvoice3-voice.py \
    --prompt-stok  artifacts/llm-ref/prompt_stok.npy \
    --prompt-token artifacts/cv3-ref/prompt_token.npy \
    --prompt-feat  artifacts/cv3-ref/prompt_feat.npy \
    --embedding    artifacts/cv3-ref/embedding.npy \
    --prompt-text "希望你以后能够做的比我还好呦。" \
    --outfile voice.gguf
```

Any 5-15 s reference clip works in place of `zero_shot_prompt.wav`; pass its
verbatim transcript as `--prompt-text`. Assemble the model directory the
engine scans:

```bash
python3 scripts/assemble-cosyvoice3-model.py \
    --llm cosyvoice3-llm-f32.gguf --flow cosyvoice3-flow-f32.gguf \
    --hift cosyvoice3-hift-f32.gguf --voice voice.gguf \
    --vocab checkpoints/cosyvoice3/CosyVoice-BlankEN/vocab.json \
    --merges checkpoints/cosyvoice3/CosyVoice-BlankEN/merges.txt \
    --s3tok cosyvoice3-s3tok-f16.gguf --campplus cosyvoice3-campplus-f32.gguf \
    --out models/cosyvoice3-0.5b
```

### Voice cloning

With no reference audio the engine speaks with the baked default voice
(`voice.gguf`). Zero-shot / cross-lingual cloning runs fully natively — the
reference wav is tokenized by a ggml port of `speech_tokenizer_v3` (12-block
FSMN encoder + FSQ, converted by `scripts/convert-s3tokenizer-v3-to-gguf.py`),
the 192-d speaker embedding comes from the CAM++ port
(`scripts/convert-campplus-to-gguf.py`; the same 3D-Speaker checkpoint
CosyVoice ships as `campplus.onnx`), and the prompt mel from the shared
matcha-compatible mel extractor. Both GGUFs are required whenever
`reference_audio` is set (`cosyvoice3-s3tok*.gguf`,
`cosyvoice3-campplus*.gguf`, auto-resolved from the model dir); a missing
model, an unreadable wav, or an out-of-range duration (0.5-30 s hard limits,
5-15 s recommended) fails construction rather than silently keeping the baked
voice.

The reference transcript selects the mode, mirroring the upstream frontends:

```bash
# zero-shot: transcript given, LM prompted with the reference speech tokens
# (best fidelity when synthesizing the reference's own language)
./build/cosyvoice-cli --model-dir models/cosyvoice3-0.5b \
  --reference-audio me.wav --prompt-text "verbatim transcript of me.wav" \
  --text "Same language as the reference." --out out.wav

# cross-lingual: no transcript, timbre-only conditioning through the flow
./build/cosyvoice-cli --model-dir models/cosyvoice3-0.5b \
  --reference-audio me.wav --text "Any other language." --out out.wav
```

The bake runs once at engine construction (roughly a second of CPU for the
tokenizer + CAM++ + mel on a short clip; the tokenizer graph rides the
engine's GPU backend when one is selected). Instruct mode composes with a
cloned voice: the instruction drives dialect/style while the cloned tensors
supply the timbre.

## Audio8

[Audio8](https://github.com/Audio8-AI/Audio8_TTS) is a DualAR zero-shot TTS
model: a 24-layer Qwen2.5-0.6B-shaped **slow AR** emits one semantic token per
codec frame, a 4-layer **fast AR** expands each of those into the frame's
remaining 9 codebooks, and a DAC-style residual-vector-quantised **codec**
turns the 10-codebook frames into 44.1 kHz audio at 2048 samples (21.5 Hz) per
frame.  Cloning needs no speaker encoder: the codec *encoder* turns a reference
wav into codes, and those codes plus the reference transcript are prepended to
the prompt.

**Status — CPU, Metal, OpenCL, and desktop Vulkan, validated against the
reference.**  Text-to-speech and voice cloning both run in-process on macOS and
iOS Metal, on Android/Adreno OpenCL, and on Linux and Windows Vulkan.  Pass
`--n-gpu-layers 99` to offload every stage; omit it for CPU.  On Metal that is
**4.2x** CPU at q4_0 and **3.2x** at q8_0 on an iPhone 17, measured on device
with both arms in one launch.  At F32 the GPU reproduces the CPU code trajectory
exactly, frame for frame, which is the strongest available statement that the
graphs compute the same function; quantised tiers fork their trajectories under
either backend and are judged by WER instead.

On OpenCL the two halves of the model behave differently and are reported
separately, because a single overall number is not reproducible on that device.
**Codec synthesis is 3.5-4.7x faster than CPU** and is stable run to run.  The
autoregressive loop is not GPU-bound at all: it is bound by the host issuing
roughly one dispatch every 24 us, so its wall time follows which CPU core the
issuing thread is scheduled onto.  Pinning that thread to the big cluster took a
q4_0 utterance from 30952/22011 ms across two runs to 17197/17201 ms — a 41%
spread collapsing to 0.02% — while codec synthesis did not move.

| backend | device | tier | codec synth | overall, same cores | overall, unpinned |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Metal | iPhone 17 | q8_0 | — | 3.2x | — |
| Metal | iPhone 17 | q4_0 | — | 4.2x | — |
| OpenCL | Adreno 740 | q8_0 | 4.7x | 1.9x | 1.1x |
| OpenCL | Adreno 740 | q4_0 | 5.1x | 2.3x | 1.3x |

Read the two overall columns as a range, not as one number with a caveat.  "Same
cores" pins both arms to the big cluster, which makes the GPU arm reproducible
(2.9% spread) but costs the CPU arm, whose five threads then contend for four
cores.  "Unpinned" is the median of every interleaved, thermally gated run, and
is what an application that does not set affinity should expect; its GPU arm
ranged 126-245 ms/frame at q8_0 for the same binary.  Both were measured on a
cold device with a 50 °C gate between arms.  Real-time factors are quoted
elsewhere in this file as wall-clock seconds per second of audio, so **lower is
faster** and a value above 1 means slower than real time.

### Convert

Three GGUFs, because the halves have different lifetimes: the LM and the codec
decoder are needed for every synthesis, the codec encoder only to enrol a voice
from a wav.  Both codec halves carry the codebooks, so each file stands alone.
`scripts/download-audio8-checkpoint.sh` fetches the upstream checkpoint from
[Audio8/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b](https://huggingface.co/Audio8/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b)
(Hugging Face CLI: `pip install -U huggingface_hub`).

```bash
scripts/download-audio8-checkpoint.sh --dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b

python3 scripts/convert-audio8-lm-to-gguf.py \
    --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b \
    --outfile models/audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf --dtype q8_0

for part in encoder decoder; do
  python3 scripts/convert-audio8-codec-to-gguf.py \
      --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b --part $part \
      --outfile models/audio8-codec-$part-q8_0.gguf --dtype q8_0
done
```

| `--dtype` | LM | codec decoder | codec encoder |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `f32` | 2.3 GB | 499 MB | 793 MB |
| `f16` | 1.2 GB | 251 MB | 398 MB |
| `q8_0` | 801 MB | 201 MB | 252 MB |
| `q4_0` | 602 MB | — | — |

**The f16 LM is free.**  The LM checkpoint ships in bfloat16, whose 8 mantissa
bits fit inside f16's 10, so half precision stores it without loss — f32 and
f16 builds agree to 3e-8, which is below the f32 rounding of the conversion
itself.  Prefer f16 over f32 unless you are debugging.  The codec ships in f32
and its f16 build is genuinely lossy (worst tensor deviation 1.6e-3).

`--dtype` sets a ceiling, not a blanket cast.  Each tensor is classified by
what it is used for, in `role_of()` in either converter: body matmuls take the
block format, bulk weights that must stay element-addressable (embedding
tables, convolution kernels) stop at f16, and tensors that decide a greedy
choice stay f32 in every build — the RoPE tables, the sampling heads, the
codebooks (the encoder picks codes by nearest neighbour, so rounding them moves
the argmin) and every 1-D parameter, the snake alphas among them.  A q4_0 codec
is not offered: over half the decoder is convolution kernels that block formats
cannot address, so the tier would buy little and cost audible quality.

Two things the converters do that are worth knowing before reading them:

- **RoPE tables are baked, not recomputed.**  The reference builds them in
  bfloat16 even under float32 inference, and that ~2e-3 rounding is not
  cosmetic — recomputing in float32 changes the greedy fast-AR codebook choices
  on the very first frame and the trajectories separate from there.
  `--rope-precision f32` is available to reproduce that measurement.  The
  tables are emitted as separate `_cos` and `_sin` planes, the shape
  `apply_rope_in_graph` consumes.
- **Q and K rows are reordered.**  The reference rotates each head's adjacent
  pair `(2j, 2j+1)`; ggml and the rest of this tree rotate `(j, head_dim/2+j)`.
  Reordering the projection rows at conversion time avoids a strided gather in
  every attention block, and attention cannot tell the difference because the
  same permutation lands on Q and K and their dot product does not depend on
  the order of the terms.  `verify-audio8-conversion.py` checks this by
  comparing attention scores, not tensors.
- **The text head is replaced by a semantic head.**  The head is tied to the
  155776-row input embedding, but the sampler masks every logit outside
  `[semantic_begin, semantic_end]` plus EOS, so the converter emits just those
  4097 rows as `lm/sem_head`.  Masked-out logits contribute nothing to the
  top-k/top-p renormalisation, so this is exact, and it turns a 155776-row
  projection per step into a 4097-row one.

### Verify

`verify-audio8-conversion.py` reloads the checkpoint through its own remote
code and compares every converted tensor against it, at a tolerance derived
from what the tensor's storage can actually represent — exact for f32, one
reconstruction step for the block formats.  It recomputes the RoPE tables
independently rather than trusting the converter's copy.

Each GGUF is also checked for completeness on its own, against the half of the
checkpoint the converter's own split says it carries, so a tensor written to
the wrong half fails here rather than at load time.  It takes any subset of the
three files, but at least one.

```bash
python3 scripts/verify-audio8-conversion.py \
    --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b \
    --lm-gguf models/audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf \
    --codec-encoder-gguf models/audio8-codec-encoder-q8_0.gguf \
    --codec-decoder-gguf models/audio8-codec-decoder-q8_0.gguf
```

### Reference fixtures

Three dumpers write the `.npy` fixtures the C++ stages will be checked against.
They capture stage boundaries, not just endpoints, so a failing stage can be
located without bisecting the network.

```bash
python3 scripts/dump-audio8-tokenizer-reference.py \
    --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b --out-dir artifacts/audio8-ref

# reference-free generation: prompt, embeddings, per-step hidden states,
# semantic logits before and after filtering, fast-AR logits, emitted codes.
# --dump-wav also decodes those codes, which test-audio8-engine compares against
python3 scripts/dump-audio8-lm-reference.py \
    --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b \
    --out-dir artifacts/audio8-ref --max-new-tokens 32 --dump-wav

# codec both ways: decode the codes above, encode a reference wav.  This is the
# recording the cloning fixtures below are enrolled from, so the tests expect it
python3 scripts/dump-audio8-codec-reference.py \
    --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b \
    --codes artifacts/audio8-ref/codes.npy \
    --audio test/reference-audio/audio8-reference-en.wav \
    --out-dir artifacts/audio8-ref

# the cloning path end to end: reference codes + transcript -> prompt -> codes
python3 scripts/dump-audio8-lm-reference.py \
    --model-dir models/Audio8-TTS-Preview-0.6b \
    --text "Tear in eye, your dress you'll tear." \
    --reference-codes artifacts/audio8-ref/codec_enc_codes.npy \
    --reference-text "What these pictures? An elephant with uh so many legs." \
    --out-dir artifacts/audio8-ref-clone --max-new-tokens 24 --dump-wav
```

The dumps are taken with `do_sample=False`.  The shipped sampler draws Gumbel
noise and applies repetition-aware resampling, neither of which reproduces
across runtimes; greedy decoding makes the trajectory comparable, and the
filtered score vectors are dumped alongside the tokens so everything feeding
the draw can be checked even where the draw itself cannot.  `--dump-wav` runs
the generated codes back through the codec so the engine test has an
end-to-end waveform to compare against, not just codes.

CTest looks for the results in fixed places, and a fixture it cannot find turns
its test into a "Not Run (Disabled)" rather than a failure, so the recipe above
writes where the tests read: the dumps into `artifacts/audio8-ref` and
`artifacts/audio8-ref-clone`, the GGUFs into `models/`.  `cmake` prints a
`disabled (missing fixture(s): ...)` line at configure time for whatever is
still absent, which is the quickest way to see that a run is thinner than it
looks.

### Run

```bash
# text only: the LM and the codec's synthesis half
audio8-cli --lm models/audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf \
           --codec-decoder models/audio8-codec-decoder-q8_0.gguf \
           --text "Hello from a fully on-device C++ pipeline." \
           --out out.wav --threads 8 --n-gpu-layers 99

# on the GPU: same command, everything on the device
audio8-cli --lm models/audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf \
           --codec-decoder models/audio8-codec-decoder-q8_0.gguf \
           --text "Hello from a fully on-device C++ pipeline." \
           --out out.wav --n-gpu-layers 99

# cloning: add the analysis half, a reference wav and what it says
audio8-cli --lm models/audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf \
           --codec-decoder models/audio8-codec-decoder-q8_0.gguf \
           --codec-encoder models/audio8-codec-encoder-q8_0.gguf \
           --ref-audio voice.wav --ref-text "What the recording says." \
           --text "Now say this instead." --out out.wav --threads 8
```

`--greedy` reproduces the fixtures; otherwise `--seed`, `--temperature`,
`--top-k` and `--top-p` drive the sampler.  `--max-frames` caps the output at
2048 samples each (~46 ms), `--output-sample-rate` resamples away from the
codec's native 44.1 kHz, and `--backends-dir` points a `GGML_BACKEND_DL` build
at its backend libraries.  The reference wav is resampled and downmixed on the
way in, so any format `dr_wav` reads will do.

`--n-gpu-layers` is all-or-nothing by design: it selects the backend the whole
model runs on rather than splitting layers across two, so any count above zero
puts everything on the device and zero keeps it on CPU.  A GPU run copies the
weights into device memory rather than mapping them, so plan for the GGUF size
again on top of the file itself.  `--verbose` prints the per-stage times and the
block width the codec settled on, and `--dump-codes` writes the discrete code
trajectory as one comma-separated line per frame, which two runs can be diffed
on to see whether a backend or a quantisation tier changed what was generated.

Codec synthesis runs in blocks whose width is chosen from a memory budget rather
than fixed: the widest block whose scratch fits a quarter of what the backend
reports free, capped at 384 MiB.  A backend that reports no total at all is
saying it cannot tell rather than that it has nothing, and gets the cap.  Blocks
exist only to bound that scratch — each one re-runs the causal context of the one
before it — so a wider block is strictly less work, and the width never changes
the samples.  Set `codec_model::synthesis_block_frames` to pin a width or
`synthesis_scratch_budget` to pin the budget.

The same thing through the library, from `<tts-cpp/audio8/engine.h>`:

```cpp
tts_cpp::audio8::EngineOptions opts;
opts.lm_gguf_path            = "models/audio8-lm-q8_0.gguf";
opts.codec_decoder_gguf_path = "models/audio8-codec-decoder-q8_0.gguf";
opts.codec_encoder_gguf_path = "models/audio8-codec-encoder-q8_0.gguf";  // cloning only

tts_cpp::audio8::Engine engine(opts);
auto plain = engine.synthesize("Hello.");

auto voice = tts_cpp::audio8::load_voice_prompt("voice.wav",
                                                "What the recording says.");
auto cloned = engine.synthesize("Now say this instead.", voice);
```

`VoicePrompt` is mono float32 plus a transcript, so a caller that already has
samples can fill it directly; `load_voice_prompt` is there for the common case
of a file on disk.

The engine holds the models resident across calls and caches the codes for the
most recent voice prompt, so re-using a reference skips the codec encoder.
`cancel()` stops an in-flight `synthesize()` at the next language model step or
codec block, whichever comes first; the call throws rather than returning a
partial waveform.

The three GGUFs have to come from one checkpoint, and the engine checks that
they do — codebook counts and widths, the codec's two halves against each other
and both against the language model — from their headers, before it reads a
byte of weights.

### Engine notes

Roughly a second of audio per second of CPU on eight cores of a desktop x86-64,
q8_0 weights: 16 s of speech in 19 s wall, 5.5 s of cloned speech in 10 s
including enrolment.

**The codec is chunked, in both directions.**  Its convolution stacks, not the
LM, are what made memory grow with utterance length — a 24 s decode used to
need a 1.5 GB arena.  Each direction is now split into a whole-sequence graph
and a block graph that walks the utterance, and each block is re-fed the exact
receptive field its stack needs (`span_through_*` in `codec_ops.cpp` walks the
strides and dilations to compute it) and drops the samples that context
produced.  The result is bit-identical to running in one pass whatever the
block size, which `test-audio8-codec` asserts by re-running both directions at
a deliberately tiny block and comparing.  Decode now holds ~130 MB flat, encode
~140 MB for a 10 s reference.  End to end that is 1.25 GB resident for
text-only and 1.67 GB for cloning, of which 1.25 GB is the q8_0 weights
themselves.

The one part that still grows with input length is the encoder's analysis
transformer: `ggml_soft_max_ext` materialises the full score matrix, so a
reference much beyond 30 s gets expensive.  References of a few seconds are
what the model expects anyway.

**Sampling follows the reference's order, which is unusual.**  top-k and top-p
run on the raw logits and the temperature is applied to what survives, so
temperature does not affect which candidates are in the running.  Semantic
tokens additionally go through repetition-aware resampling: drawing a token
that already appears in a short trailing window triggers one re-draw at a
narrower nucleus and a higher temperature.  The window holds tokens the model
actually drew and nothing else, so an utterance opens with no history at all;
the opening token stays out of it, as it does in the reference.  `--greedy`
bypasses all of it.

### Test

The C++ stages are checked against the fixtures above, one CTest target per
stage boundary:

```bash
ctest -R audio8 --output-on-failure
```

| target | checks |
|---|---|
| `test-audio8-tokenizer` | BPE ids and the ChatML prompt, both cloning and not |
| `test-audio8-lm` | prompt embeddings, per-step hidden states, semantic and fast-AR logits, emitted codes |
| `test-audio8-codec` | encode and decode at every stage boundary, block-size independence, and that a cancel stops the block loop |
| `test-audio8-sampler` | filtered score vectors, which is the part of the draw that is reproducible |
| `test-audio8-ras` | the repetition-aware window: which draws enter it, eligibility, eviction, and the retry's nucleus |
| `test-audio8-engine` | both public paths end to end against the decoded waveforms, and the refusal of GGUFs that disagree |
| `test-audio8-timing` | that the per-stage times are disjoint and bounded by the total they are reported against |
| `test-audio8-cli` | the CLI's flags, `-ngl` and `--n-gpu-layers` among them, and the `--dump-codes` file format |
| `test-audio8-cli-verbose` | the same flags through the binary: `--verbose` reaching stderr and codes surviving a synthesis |
| `test-audio8-sampling-filter` | the top-k / top-p / temperature candidate filter on synthetic score vectors: k and p cutoffs, temperature ordering, degenerate cases |

`test-audio8-ras`, `test-audio8-cli`, and `test-audio8-sampling-filter` are the
three that run on a checkout with no models; every other target needs the
dumps.

On a build with a GPU backend compiled in, the `lm`, `codec` and `engine`
suites are registered a second time per backend as `test-audio8-<suite>-metal`,
`-vulkan` and `-opencl`. Each arm names its backend in `AUDIO8_TEST_GPU` and
asserts it before reading a number, so an arm that fell back to CPU, or that was
handed the other arm's GPU, fails rather than passing on someone else's result.

The engine test hands the cloning path a wav rather than pre-computed codes, so
it exercises the codec encoder the way a caller would.

## LavaSR enhancement

LavaSR is post-processing for synthesized or captured speech, not another
text-to-speech engine. The denoiser uses a 16 kHz internal STFT and preserves
the requested output rate; the bandwidth-extension enhancer emits 48 kHz.
Public APIs are installed under `<tts-cpp/lavasr/>`, and `lavasr-bench`
exercises the denoiser, enhancer, or two-stage pipeline. Backend support differs
between the two stages, so use the capability matrix rather than assuming every
compiled ggml backend applies to both.

### Convert

`scripts/download-lavasr-onnx.sh` fetches the LavaSRcpp ONNX release assets
the two converters read (the original torch weights live at
[YatharthS/LavaSR](https://huggingface.co/YatharthS/LavaSR)); both converters
accept `--ftype {f32,f16}`:

```bash
scripts/download-lavasr-onnx.sh --dir checkpoints/lavasr

python3 scripts/convert-lavasr-denoiser-to-gguf.py \
    --denoiser checkpoints/lavasr/denoiser_core_legacy_fixed63.onnx \
    --out models/lavasr-denoiser-f32.gguf
python3 scripts/convert-lavasr-enhancer-to-gguf.py \
    --backbone checkpoints/lavasr/enhancer_backbone.onnx \
    --spec-head checkpoints/lavasr/enhancer_spec_head.onnx \
    --out models/lavasr-enhancer-f32.gguf
```

### Run

`lavasr-bench` runs the two-stage pipeline over a wav and can write both
stage outputs:

```bash
./build/lavasr-bench --denoiser models/lavasr-denoiser-f32.gguf \
                     --enhancer models/lavasr-enhancer-f32.gguf \
                     --in noisy.wav \
                     --out-denoised denoised.wav --out-enhanced enhanced-48k.wav
```

`test-lavasr-gguf-load` needs no fixtures: it synthesizes tiny metadata-only
GGUFs and asserts both stage loaders fail closed on a missing, empty,
truncated, unmarked, cross-architecture, or tensorless file. The denoiser and
enhancer GGUFs differ only by `general.architecture`, so each loader has to
refuse the other's file.

## Build paths

Prerequisites are CMake 3.20 or newer, a C++17 compiler, and either an installed
`ggml` CMake package from the `ggml-speech` port or a `qvac-ext-ggml@speech`
checkout staged by `scripts/setup-ggml.sh` for the bundled path.

| Path | Configure entry | ggml source | Main artifacts |
|---|---|---|---|
| Umbrella speech build | repository root, `-DSPEECH_BUILD_TTS=ON` | system `ggml` | `build/engines/tts/tts-cli` and sibling tools; library under `build/engines/tts/` |
| Direct in-tree package | `engines/tts` | system `ggml`; `TTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=ON` is required | `engines/tts/build/tts-cli` and `engines/tts/build/libtts-cpp.*` |
| Bundled ggml | `engines/tts` with `TTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=OFF` | `engines/tts/ggml` checkout of `qvac-ext-ggml@speech`, staged by `scripts/setup-ggml.sh` | `engines/tts/build-bundled/tts-cli` and `engines/tts/build-bundled/libtts-cpp.*` |
| vcpkg consumer | `tts-cpp` port | `ggml-speech` dependency | `<vcpkg>/installed/<triplet>/lib/` (or `debug/lib/`), headers under `include/tts-cpp/`, config under `share/tts-cpp/` |

The bundled path applies no patch overlay — the speech branch is patched at
the commit level. `scripts/setup-ggml.sh` clones the pinned speech ref into
`engines/tts/ggml/` and is idempotent on re-run; bump `GGML_REF` in the script
to move the pin. The separate
`chatterbox.cpp` repository has its own pinned bundled-ggml setup flow and
produces artifacts under its own `build/`.

### Umbrella build

From the repository root:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/ggml-speech/install \
  -DSPEECH_BUILD_TTS=ON
cmake --build build --target tts-cli
```

`SPEECH_BUILD_EXECUTABLES` controls all engine CLIs and defaults to `ON`;
`SPEECH_BUILD_TESTS` controls TTS test harnesses and defaults to `OFF`.

### Direct in-tree build

From the repository root:

```bash
cmake -S engines/tts -B engines/tts/build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/ggml-speech/install
cmake --build engines/tts/build --target tts-cli
```

The detailed commands below assume `cd engines/tts`, so direct-build
executables are shown as `build/<name>`.

### Bundled-ggml build

Stage `qvac-ext-ggml@speech` as `engines/tts/ggml`, then configure:

```bash
bash engines/tts/scripts/setup-ggml.sh
cmake -S engines/tts -B engines/tts/build-bundled \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DTTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=OFF
cmake --build engines/tts/build-bundled --target tts-cli
```

### Windows and multi-config generators

Use a Developer PowerShell or Developer Command Prompt and quote paths:

```powershell
cmake -S engines/tts -B engines/tts/build `
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=C:\src\vcpkg\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build engines/tts/build --config Release --target tts-cli
engines\tts\build\Release\tts-cli.exe --help
ctest --test-dir engines/tts/build -C Release -L unit --output-on-failure
```

Visual Studio and other multi-config generators place executables under
`Release\` (or the selected configuration) and require `ctest -C Release`.
Single-config Ninja/Make generators use the artifact paths in the table.

### vcpkg consumer

The port installs the library and public headers, not the development CLIs:

```cmake
find_package(tts-cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE tts-cpp::tts-cpp)
```

### Conversion tooling

- C++17 compiler (clang, gcc, or MSVC)
- CMake 3.20 or newer
- Python 3.10+ with `torch`, `numpy`, `onnx`, `gguf`, `huggingface_hub`,
  `safetensors`, `scipy`, `librosa`, `resampy` — needed **once**, at setup time only, to run the
  weight converters (which bake the precomputed mel filterbanks into the
  GGUFs) and the optional reference-dump scripts. Once the GGUFs exist,
  the C++ binary has zero runtime dependency on Python.

The easiest way to get the Python side is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git chatterbox-ref
cd chatterbox-ref
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
pip install onnx gguf huggingface_hub safetensors scipy librosa resampy
cd -
```

### In-tree system-ggml details

This in-tree subtree is built against the [`ggml-speech`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-registry-vcpkg)
vcpkg port (which vendors the [`qvac-ext-ggml/speech`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml/tree/speech)
branch with all patches pre-applied).  `tts-cpp` itself is consumed
through the matching `tts-cpp` port; downstream applications in the
QVAC speech stack add both to their `vcpkg.json` and call
`find_package(tts-cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)`:

```cmake
find_package(tts-cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE tts-cpp::tts-cpp)
```

For development in this tree (running parity harnesses, prototyping API
changes, and inspecting CLIs), use the direct in-tree system-ggml flow:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/ggml-speech/install
cmake --build build --target tts-cli
```

Downstream production builds normally use the vcpkg toolchain:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg_root>/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
cmake --build build --target tts-cpp
```

`TTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML` defaults to `ON` for this flow, finding
the `ggml-speech` port from qvac-registry-vcpkg (which pulls
qvac-ext-ggml@speech with patches as commits).  GPU acceleration is
selected at the ggml-port level — the port already carries the
Metal / Vulkan / OpenCL backend support its consumers ask for; pass
`--n-gpu-layers 99` at runtime to actually use the compiled GPU
backend.

### Useful CMake options

Project-namespaced flags (all default to a sensible standalone build;
override with `-D<flag>=...` at configure time):

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|------|---------|---------|
| `TTS_CPP_BUILD_LIBRARY` | `ON` | Build the `tts-cpp` library target itself (linkage controlled by `TTS_CPP_BUILD_SHARED`, not `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` — see below) |
| `TTS_CPP_BUILD_SHARED` | `OFF` | Build `tts-cpp` as `SHARED` instead of `STATIC`. Decoupled from `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` because ggml's own CMake declares its own `option(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS)` defaulting to `ON` on Windows non-MinGW; using a project-namespaced option keeps the two independent. The supertonic test/bench harnesses link against `tts-cpp` directly and use detail-namespaced symbols outside the `TTS_CPP_API` public surface, so `SHARED` builds hide them and disable those targets — leave OFF for development, flip ON only for downstream packaging where the test harnesses aren't built |
| `TTS_CPP_BUILD_EXECUTABLES` | `ON` standalone / `OFF` subdir | `tts-cli`, `mel2wav`, `cosyvoice-hift`, `cosyvoice-flow`, `cosyvoice-llm`, `cosyvoice-cli`, `cosyvoice-bench`, `supertonic-cli`, `parler-cli`, `parler-bench`, `lavasr-bench`, and `audio8-cli` |
| `TTS_CPP_BUILD_TESTS` | `ON` standalone / `OFF` subdir | `test-*` parity / unit harnesses, registered with CTest (label-filterable via `ctest -L unit` / `ctest -L fixture` / `ctest -L gpu`) |
| `TTS_CPP_INSTALL` | `ON` | Generate `install` rules + the `tts-cpp` CMake package config so consumers can `find_package(tts-cpp CONFIG REQUIRED)` |
| `TTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML` | `ON` | Use `find_package(ggml CONFIG REQUIRED)` against `ggml-speech`. `OFF` uses `add_subdirectory(ggml)` and requires an `engines/tts/ggml` checkout of `qvac-ext-ggml@speech`, staged by `scripts/setup-ggml.sh`; no patch overlay — the speech branch is patched at the commit level |
| ~~`TTS_CPP_GGML_LIB_PREFIX`~~ | n/a in this subtree | The standalone `chatterbox.cpp` repo exposes this option to rename bundled `libggml-*` to `libspeech-ggml-*`. This in-tree package does not expose the option: system builds use the filenames installed by `ggml-speech`, while bundled builds use the filenames produced by the locally staged speech-branch checkout |
| `TTS_CPP_CCACHE` | `ON` | Use ccache as compiler launcher for `tts-cpp`'s own targets when `find_program(ccache)` succeeds. Scoped per target; ggml's independent `GGML_CCACHE` option handles the ggml subdirectory |
| `TTS_CPP_OPENMP` | `ON` | Link OpenMP when available. On Windows non-MinGW builds it is forced `OFF` to avoid clang-cl/MSVC and msys2 `libgomp` incompatibilities; advanced callers can explicitly set both `TTS_CPP_OPENMP_USER_OVERRIDE=ON` and `TTS_CPP_OPENMP=ON` |

When tests are enabled, the build also exposes three cache-overridable
fixture roots that the registered ctest entries resolve against:

| CACHE PATH | Default | Used by |
|------------|---------|---------|
| `TTS_CPP_TEST_MODEL_DIR` | `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/models`               | GGUF checkpoints (produced by `scripts/convert-*-to-gguf.py` or `bash scripts/setup-supertonic2.sh`) |
| `TTS_CPP_TEST_AUDIO_DIR` | `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/test/reference-audio` | Reference WAV fixtures (e.g. `test/reference-audio/jfk.wav`) |
| `TTS_CPP_TEST_REF_DIR`   | `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/artifacts`            | `.npy` reference dumps from `scripts/dump-{s3gen,supertonic,t3-mtl}-reference.py` |

Tests whose required fixtures don't exist at configure time are
auto-marked `DISABLED` (they still appear in `ctest -N` output but
return `Not Run` instead of failing), so a fresh checkout still gives
a green `ctest` run on the harnesses whose fixtures it does have.

## Command-line tools

|--------|--------------|
| `build/supertonic-bench` | Per-stage Supertonic benchmark harness (`--text` / `--out` / `--runs`); machine-readable RTF + per-stage timings |
| `build/test-s3gen`            | Staged numerical validation of S3Gen encoder + CFM vs Python dumps |
| `build/test-resample`         | Round-trip SNR of the C++ Kaiser-windowed sinc resampler + output-frequency helpers (validate / passthrough / ratio) |
| `build/test-output-sample-rate` | `--output-sample-rate` on `chatterbox::Engine`: native/16 kHz batch, out-of-range rejection, streaming `pcm == concat(chunks)` invariant (needs the MTL GGUFs) |
| `build/test-voice-features`   | 24 kHz 80-ch mel parity (prompt_feat) |
| `build/test-fbank`            | 16 kHz 80-ch Kaldi fbank parity |

| `build/test-t3-mtl-stages`    | Staged MTL T3 parity (cond/text/inputs/layers/head) |
| `build/test-cpu-caches`       | CPU-side persistent-cache validation (time_mlp / time_emb / cfm_estimator / weight_mirror caches that amortise per-synth overhead on the multilingual CPU path); no-arg invocation runs the bit-cast cache-key + initial-state checks, GGUF arg runs the warm-cache + bit-exact pipeline check |
| `build/test-t3-caches`        | T3 step-graph cache validation (no-arg = initial-state, GGUF arg = warm-cache + bit-exact end-to-end check) |
| `build/test-supertonic-*`     | Per-stage Supertonic parity harnesses (`preprocess`, `vocoder` ± `trace` / `pointwise`, `duration` ± `trace`, `text-encoder` ± `trace`, `vector` ± `trace`, `pipeline`); each takes `MODEL.gguf REF_DIR` |
| `build/test-metal-ops`        | Metal-only: parity check for `diag_mask_inf`, `pad_ext`, and fast `conv_transpose_1d` (only useful when built with `-DGGML_METAL=ON`) |
| `build/test-cosyvoice-time-emb` | Sinusoidal timestep embedding for the CosyVoice3 flow DiT: sin/cos layout, the 1000x scale, the four-decade frequency schedule, batch-row independence (no GGUF) |
| `build/test-lavasr-gguf-load`   | Fail-closed GGUF loading for both LavaSR stages: missing, empty, truncated, unmarked, cross-architecture, and tensorless files (no GGUF) |

The test targets register with CTest. From a single-config build directory use
`ctest -L unit` or `ctest -L fixture`; with Visual Studio or another
multi-config generator add `-C Release`.

### How `TTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=ON` resolves ggml

When the option is `ON` (the default in this in-tree subtree), the
top-level `CMakeLists.txt` swaps `add_subdirectory(ggml)` for
`find_package(ggml CONFIG REQUIRED)` and aliases the imported
`ggml::ggml` target onto the plain `ggml` name that the rest of the
build uses.  No local `./ggml/` clone is read.  The imported package
ships the equivalent of the patches the standalone `chatterbox.cpp`
repo applies via `patches/` - the `qvac-ext-ggml/speech` branch
carries them pre-applied so consumers don't maintain a patch trail.
This shape mirrors `stable-diffusion.cpp`'s `SD_USE_SYSTEM_GGML`.

## One-time: convert weights

```bash
# Activate the Python environment from the Conversion tooling step
. chatterbox-ref/.venv/bin/activate

# --- Turbo (English, default) ---
python scripts/convert-t3-turbo-to-gguf.py --out models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf
python scripts/convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py    --out models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf

# --- Multilingual (23 languages) ---
python scripts/convert-t3-mtl-to-gguf.py            --out models/chatterbox-t3-mtl.gguf
python scripts/convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py --variant mtl --out models/chatterbox-s3gen-mtl.gguf

# --- Multilingual, quantised (recommended for speed) ---
# Matches the RTF numbers in the benchmark table above.  --quant accepts
# {f32,f16,q8_0,q5_0,q4_0} on convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py (default f16) and
# {f16,q8_0,q5_0,q4_0} on convert-t3-mtl-to-gguf.py (default f16, since
# the T3 storage baseline is already F16).  The flag controls the large
# matmul weights only — biases, LayerNorm gammas/betas, embedding tables,
# voice encoders, and built-in voice conditioning always stay at full
# precision (see the deny-list in scripts/requantize-gguf.py for the
# exact policy; the same policy is used by all three tools).
python scripts/convert-t3-mtl-to-gguf.py --quant q4_0 \
       --out models/chatterbox-t3-mtl-q4_0.gguf
python scripts/convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py  --variant mtl --quant q4_0 \
       --out models/chatterbox-s3gen-mtl-q4_0.gguf
```

The Turbo converter pulls `ResembleAI/chatterbox-turbo` (~1.5 GB), the MTL
converter pulls `ResembleAI/chatterbox` (~3 GB).  The BPE tokenizer for
Turbo (`vocab.json` + `merges.txt` + `added_tokens.json`) is **embedded
directly into the T3 GGUF** as `tokenizer.ggml.*` metadata; for MTL we
embed the full HuggingFace `tokenizers.json` blob (plus a Korean-Jamo /
NFKD Unicode table for offline preprocessing), so in both cases you don't
need to keep the source tokenizer files around on disk.

The quantisation flag on `convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py` is new as of §3.20 —
it's pure data-format work, so the binary needs no changes and every
backend (CPU, Metal, Vulkan, CUDA) picks up the faster matmul kernels
transparently.  The per-tensor decision lives in `should_quantize()`
inside `scripts/requantize-gguf.py` (single source of truth shared
with the offline rewriter): biases, norm scales, embedding tables,
spectral filterbanks, voice-cloning preprocessors (CAMPPlus,
VoiceEncoder, S3TokenizerV2) and any tensor whose reduction dim isn't
block-aligned all stay at full precision.  See `PROGRESS.md §3.20` for
the full deny-list and resulting size / speed numbers.

You should now have (either pair is usable on its own):

```

  # Optional quantised multilingual variants — numerically very close to F16 but
  # ~1.5-2x faster on every backend (CPU/Metal/Vulkan/CUDA) due to lower weight
  # memory bandwidth.  Recommended for production use; see benchmark table above.
  chatterbox-t3-mtl-q4_0.gguf     (~344 MB) — Q4_0 T3 Llama-520M
  chatterbox-s3gen-mtl-q4_0.gguf  (~685 MB) — Q4_0 MTL S3Gen
```

For numerical validation against PyTorch (optional, step 4), also run:

```bash
python scripts/dump-s3gen-reference.py \
  --text "Hello from ggml." --out artifacts/s3gen-ref \
  --seed 42 --n-predict 64 --device cpu
```

### Optional: quantize the models (smaller + faster)

Both GGUFs can be quantized to `Q8_0` (near-lossless), `Q5_0`, or
`Q4_0` (different CFM sample but same subjective quality, smaller).
The same machinery works on the multilingual GGUFs too — the
benchmark numbers at the top of this README use the q4_0 variants
shown there.  `llama-quantize` doesn't recognize the `chatterbox` /
`chatterbox-s3gen` custom architectures, so we ship a small standalone
rewriter that works on any of the four GGUFs:

```bash
# T3
python scripts/requantize-gguf.py \
  models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
  models/t3-q8_0.gguf q8_0

# S3Gen
python scripts/requantize-gguf.py \
  models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
  models/chatterbox-s3gen-q8_0.gguf q8_0
```

Swap `q8_0` → `q4_0` (or `q5_0`) for a more aggressive variant.  T3's
original converter also accepts `--quant` if you prefer to quantize at
conversion time instead of after.

Measured on a representative paragraph (M3 Ultra, Metal, streaming mode
`--stream-chunk-tokens 25 --max-sentence-chars 100`):

| T3 / S3Gen                | total size | first-audio | total wall | cos sim¹ |
|---------------------------|-----------:|------------:|-----------:|--------:|
| F16 / F32 (baseline)      |  1 757 MB  |  1 604 ms   |   28.6 s   |  1.000  |
| Q8_0 / F32                |  1 476 MB  |  1 451 ms   |   27.2 s   |   —     |
| F16 / Q8_0                |  1 532 MB  |  1 646 ms   |   28.2 s   |  0.991  |
| **Q8_0 / Q8_0**           | **1 251 MB** | **1 399 ms** | **26.4 s** | 0.991 |
| **Q4_0 / Q4_0**           | **1 071 MB** | **1 510 ms** | **26.7 s** | 0.66²  |

¹ Cosine similarity of the final waveform vs the F16/F32 baseline.

² Q4_0 quantization shifts the CFM diffusion ODE's trajectory enough
  to land on a *different sample* from the same noise seed.  Subjective
  quality is essentially the same (in-distribution speech, correct
  phonemes, stable voice); it's just a different legitimate sample
  rather than a lower-fidelity version of the baseline.

Using both Q8_0 variants cuts **~500 MB off disk**, drops first-audio
latency **~13 %**, speeds total wall-clock **~8 %**, and produces
audibly-identical output (cos-sim > 0.99 vs F32 reference waveform).
Q4_0 trims another ~180 MB on top for roughly the same speed — best
choice on memory-constrained targets (mobile, low-end CPUs) when you
don't need per-seed reproducibility against the F32 baseline.

Note: the S3Gen requantize script only compresses the 385 big 2-D
matmul weights (encoder attention/MLPs + CFM projections + flow FFs).
The 1 664 other tensors — biases, norms, spectral filterbanks, the
input-embedding table, the 3-D convolution weights — remain at their
source dtype to keep numerics clean.  That's why Q4_0 ends up only
~15 % smaller than Q8_0 rather than 2× smaller; the bulk not covered
by block quantization dominates.

Pass the quantized GGUFs to `tts-cli` exactly like the defaults:

```bash
./build/tts-cli \
  --model      models/t3-q8_0.gguf \
  --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen-q8_0.gguf \
  --text "Hello from the quantized port." \
  --n-gpu-layers 99 --out out.wav
```

## Run — end-to-end text → wav

The easiest way:

```bash
./scripts/synthesize.sh "Hello from native C plus plus." /tmp/out.wav
```

That's equivalent to running the binary directly:

```bash
./build/tts-cli \
  --model       models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
  --s3gen-gguf  models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
  --text        "Hello from native C plus plus." \
  --out         /tmp/out.wav
```

**Multilingual** takes the same flags plus a required `--language CODE`
(one of the tier-1 codes listed at the top of the README) and runs all the
CFG / perceiver / 10-step-CFM machinery automatically based on the GGUF's
`chatterbox.variant` metadata:

```bash
./build/tts-cli \
  --model       models/chatterbox-t3-mtl.gguf \
  --s3gen-gguf  models/chatterbox-s3gen-mtl.gguf \
  --text        "Hola, esto es una demostración multilingüe." \
  --language    es \
  --out         /tmp/mtl_es.wav
```

Extra MTL-only knobs: `--cfg-weight F` (default 0.5, must be ≥ 0),
`--min-p F` (0.05, in [0, 1]), `--exaggeration F` (0.5 — emotion
intensity, in [0, 1]).  `--reference-audio` works
the same way on both variants.

`--cfm-steps N` lowers the CFM Euler step count for non-streaming
synthesis (default 10 for Multilingual's standard CFM).  N=7 saves ~22%
of S3Gen wall time at log-mel cosine 0.995 vs the N=10 reference and is
the recommended quality knee on M3 Ultra (see [`PROGRESS.md §3.21`](PROGRESS.md));
N=6 is too aggressive (cosine 0.990 right at the threshold, PCM cosine
drops to 0.88).  Streaming chunks ignore this flag and use
`--stream-cfm-steps` instead.

`--output-sample-rate HZ` selects the output frequency. The
pipeline natively emits 24 kHz (Chatterbox) / the model's metadata rate
(Supertonic); pass a positive rate in `8000..192000` to resample the final
PCM with the in-tree Kaiser-windowed sinc resampler before it's written or
streamed (e.g. `--output-sample-rate 16000` for a 16 kHz wav).  `0` (the
default) keeps the native rate — zero behaviour change.  Works on the
single-shot, auto-split, and streaming paths and on both engines (the
`tts_cpp::*::EngineOptions::output_sample_rate` field exposes the same knob
to library callers; `SynthesisResult::sample_rate` always reports the actual
rate).

Everything is self-contained in the two `.gguf` files:

- `chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf` embeds the BPE tokenizer (vocab + merges +
  added tokens) as standard `tokenizer.ggml.*` metadata, which the C++
  binary loads out of GGUF at startup. The tokenizer itself (merge chains,
  byte-level encoding, added-token spans, `punc_norm`) is pinned model-free
  by `test-gpt2-bpe` on a hand-built vocabulary.
- `chatterbox-s3gen.gguf` embeds the built-in reference voice (embedding,
  prompt token, prompt mel) under `s3gen/builtin/*`.

Advanced modes:

- **T3 only** — drop `--s3gen-gguf` + `--out`; write tokens with
  `--output tokens.txt`. Useful for piping into other tools.
- **S3Gen + HiFT only** — pass `--s3gen-gguf` + `--tokens-file FILE` with
  already-generated speech tokens and no `--model`.
- **Custom voice (voice cloning)** — point `--reference-audio` at a
  reference `.wav` and the C++ binary does everything else natively
  (no Python, no preprocessing step):

  ```bash
  ./build/tts-cli --model models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
                     --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
                     --reference-audio me.wav \
                     --text "Hello in my voice." \
                     --out out.wav
  ```

  Requirements for the reference wav:
  - **Strictly more than 5 s** of clean mono speech (the binary enforces
    this and fails fast; 10–15 s gives the best similarity).
  - Any sample rate, any PCM bit-depth (binary resamples + downmixes).

  **Prep helper** — `scripts/extract-voice.py` automates the usual
  chore of picking a good clip out of a messy recording (podcast,
  WhatsApp voice note, `.mov` screen capture, etc.):

  ```bash
  # auto-detect codec, pick the best 10 s speech block, write voices/alice.wav:
  ./scripts/extract-voice.py ~/Downloads/alice.m4a --name alice
  # same, but also bake the .npy profile in one go:
  ./scripts/extract-voice.py ~/Downloads/alice.m4a --name alice --bake
  ```

  It probes the file, runs `silencedetect` to find speech regions,
  picks the longest clean 5–15 s block from the middle of the
  recording (or concatenates the two best short blocks if no single
  long block exists), then applies a codec-aware filter chain:

  | source codec                         | chain applied                                                                 |
  |--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | WAV / FLAC / ≥ 96 kbps AAC / ≥ 128 kbps MP3 | `highpass + alimiter` — minimal, trusts the source                      |
  | Opus / Vorbis at any bitrate, low-bitrate AAC/MP3 | `highpass + afftdn + 3-band EQ + loudnorm + alimiter` — restores presence/air past the codec's brick-wall low-pass |

  The lossy chain is what takes an 18 kbps Opus voice note from
  "clone sounds wrong" to "clone sounds like the speaker".  See
  `./scripts/extract-voice.py --help` for the full flag set.

  Loudness is normalised to **-27 LUFS** (ITU-R BS.1770-4 / EBU R 128)
  internally before preprocessing, so a quiet recording like a phone
  memo works as well as a studio track.  All five voice-conditioning
  tensors are produced in C++:

  | tensor                         | source                           |
  |--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
  | `speaker_emb`                  | C++ VoiceEncoder  (T3 GGUF)      |
  | `cond_prompt_speech_tokens`    | C++ S3TokenizerV2 (S3Gen GGUF)   |
  | `prompt_token`                 | C++ S3TokenizerV2 (S3Gen GGUF)   |
  | `embedding`                    | C++ CAMPPlus      (S3Gen GGUF)   |
  | `prompt_feat`                  | C++ mel extraction               |

- **Cache a voice for fast reuse (`--save-voice`)** — voice preprocessing
  (VoiceEncoder + CAMPPlus + S3TokenizerV2 + mel) adds ≈ 2 minutes on a
  Mac before every synthesis.  The five tensors don't depend on the
  text, so bake them once:

  ```bash
  # Bake the profile (no --text needed; just preprocesses + saves).
  ./build/tts-cli --model models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
                     --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
                     --reference-audio me.wav \
                     --save-voice voices/me/
  # Writes voices/me/{speaker_emb, cond_prompt_speech_tokens,
  # embedding, prompt_token, prompt_feat}.npy (~160 KB total).

  # Reuse (≈ 17× faster; VoiceEncoder / CAMPPlus / S3TokenizerV2
  # / mel extraction are all skipped).
  ./build/tts-cli --model models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
                     --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
                     --ref-dir voices/me/ \
                     --text "Anything you want." \
                     --out  out.wav
  ```

  You can mix the two: `--ref-dir D --reference-audio X.wav` will load
  any `.npy` present in `D` and compute the rest from `X.wav`.  Useful
  during development when you want to iterate on one tensor.

Play the result:

```bash
afplay /tmp/out.wav         # macOS
aplay  /tmp/out.wav         # Linux (alsa)
ffplay /tmp/out.wav         # any OS with ffmpeg
```

### Live / streaming input

When you want a long-running process that keeps the model loaded and
synthesises whatever text arrives as it arrives — e.g. the output of
a streaming LLM, a live transcription, or just a human typing —
use `--input-file`.  The binary `tail -f`'s the file, splits on
sentence terminators (or `\n` in `--input-by-line` mode), and pipes
raw PCM (s16le, 24 kHz, mono) to stdout chunk-by-chunk.

```bash
# Two-process demo: background writer appends sentences, tts-cli
# tail-follows, sox plays in real time.
./build/tts-cli \
    --model       models/t3-q8_0.gguf \
    --s3gen-gguf  models/chatterbox-s3gen-q8_0.gguf \
    --ref-dir     voices/alice \
    --input-file  ./speech.txt \
    --input-by-line \
    --stream-chunk-tokens 25 --stream-cfm-steps 2 \
    --n-gpu-layers 99 \
    --out -                     \
  | play -q -t raw -r 24000 -b 16 -e signed -c 1 -   # sox(1)

# Another process (LLM, transcriber, shell, etc.) writes here:
echo "First request." >> speech.txt
echo "Second request with, internal, punctuation." >> speech.txt
```

**Interactive mode on a TTY** — pass `--input-file -` to read from
stdin.  On a terminal you get a `> ` prompt; each Enter-terminated
line is spoken immediately, Ctrl-D exits:

```bash
./build/tts-cli \
    --model       models/t3-q8_0.gguf \
    --s3gen-gguf  models/chatterbox-s3gen-q8_0.gguf \
    --ref-dir     voices/alice \
    --input-file  - --input-by-line \
    --stream-chunk-tokens 25 --stream-cfm-steps 2 \
    --n-gpu-layers 99 \
    --out -                     \
  | play -q -t raw -r 24000 -b 16 -e signed -c 1 -
```

| `--stream-chunk-tokens N`     | Speech-token chunk granularity for the S3Gen streaming loop.  25 is a good default.                                   |
| `--stream-cfm-steps N`        | CFM Euler steps per chunk.  2 is the minimum the model was designed for; 4–5 gives crisper word endings on cloned voices. |
| `--stream-first-chunk-tokens N` | Override the first chunk's size to minimise first-audio-out latency.                                                |

The process keeps the T3 + S3Gen models warm across requests, so
after the initial load (~150 ms), each request only pays T3 + S3Gen
inference cost (well under real-time on any GPU backend).

### Useful flags

- `--seed N` — change the RNG seed for the CFM initial noise and the SineGen
  excitation (same text, different voice "take").
- `--threads N` — override the CLI default, which caps automatic selection at
  4. Library Chatterbox, Parler, and Audio8 engines use the same cap; do not
  infer CosyVoice stage threading from this flag.
- `--n-gpu-layers N` — move layers to the GPU backend when built with
  `-DGGML_METAL=ON` / `-DGGML_CUDA=ON` / `-DGGML_VULKAN=ON`.  Pass `99`
  (or any large number) to move everything.
- `--reference-audio PATH` — voice cloning input (see the Custom voice
  section above).
- `--save-voice DIR` — cache the five voice-conditioning tensors for
  reuse via `--ref-dir DIR`.
- `--ref-dir DIR` — load previously-baked voice tensors (or a subset)
  from `DIR/*.npy`.
- `--input-file PATH` — long-running mode; tail-follow `PATH` and
  synthesise text as it arrives.  Pass `-` to read from stdin (see the
  Live / streaming input section above).
- `--input-by-line` — treat one newline as one complete request; `. ! ?`
  inside a line stay part of the same utterance.
- `--debug` (requires `--ref-dir`) — substitute Python-dumped reference
  values for the random bits so every stage can be bit-exactly compared
  to PyTorch.

## Performance

End-to-end speed; `RTF = generation_time / audio_duration` (lower is faster).
The authoritative Linux x86-64 numbers come from CI (table below); the
Apple-silicon figures are maintainer measurements (no CI Metal runner). Shared
setup for the Apple rows:

- Text: *"Hello from native C plus plus. This audio was generated end
  to end on CPU using ggml."*
- Reference voice: `test/reference-audio/jfk.wav` (11 s mono 16 kHz)
- Seed: 42, warm 3-run average, inference only (excludes model load)

### CI benchmarks (latest `ggml-speech`, Linux x86-64)

End-to-end RTF measured in CI on the `tetherto/qvac` self-hosted runners, using
the q4 GGUFs from the QVAC model registry, 1 warmup + 5 timed runs.
`RTF = generation_time / audio_duration` (lower is faster; RTF is the
backend-comparable metric, wall time is workload-specific).

On Apple Silicon the Metal build runs end to end at **6.4× real time**; the
CPU-only build stays just under real time.

### Multilingual (Apple M4, F16 weights)

Same prompt + seed run through both variants on the same M4, for apples-to-
apples comparison.  MTL is 30 transformer layers vs Turbo's 24 plus CFG on
both T3 and CFM (2 forward passes per step), and it samples standard CFM
for 10 Euler steps instead of Turbo's meanflow 2.

| Config                              | T3 infer            | S3Gen infer | Audio | **RTF** |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------:|-------------:|------:|--------:|
| Turbo, Metal                        |  788 ms /  73 tok   |    768 ms    | 3.04 s| 0.51    |
| Turbo, CPU 4t                       | 1 721 ms /  73 tok  |  3 334 ms    | 3.04 s| 1.66    |
| Multilingual, Metal *(batched CFM)* | 1 865 ms /  61 tok  |  2 247 ms    | 2.56 s| 1.61    |
| Multilingual, CPU 4t *(2-call CFM)*³| 3 210 ms /  85 tok  | 25 660 ms    | 3.52 s| 8.20    |

The MTL Metal path packs the CFG cond+uncond into a single batch=2
decoder forward (`use_b2 = !ggml_backend_is_cpu(...)`), since kernel
dispatch overhead amortises well across the bigger workload; on ggml-cpu
the extra permute+cont ops that a batched attention block needs regress
throughput, so CPU keeps the two-call path.  See
[`PROGRESS.md §3.19`](PROGRESS.md) for the measurement and a discussion
of where the MTL slowdown lives relative to Turbo.

³ Re-measured on the same M4 host after commit `6d9b42b` restored the
CFG combine on the non-`use_b2` (CPU) CFM path.  The previous row in
this table (`2 711 ms / 71 tok`, `8 029 ms`, `RTF 3.63`) was captured
while CPU was silently running only the conditional CFM pass — i.e.
half the CFM compute and no classifier-free guidance steering.  S3Gen
wall-time roughly doubled (one extra forward call per CFM step) and
RTF went from 3.63 → 8.20.  The remeasurement here uses a different
local reference wav (the original `jfk.wav` was not present on the
host) — that accounts for the slightly larger token count (85 vs the
original 71); the per-audio-second cost ratio is what shifted, ~2×,
in line with restoring the missing pass.  Turbo and the Metal
multilingual row are
unaffected — they always carried the CFG combine.

### Multilingual (Mac Studio M3 Ultra, after §3.21 optimisation pass)

Same Spanish prompt (`"Hola, esto es una demostración multilingüe."`,
`--language es`), `jfk.wav` voice, seed 42, greedy (`--temp 0 --top-k 1`),
3 warm runs averaged.  T3 is now CFG-batched into a single Metal forward
(B=2, mirrors S3Gen's `use_b2`); MLP uses `ggml_swiglu_split` so the 30
SiLU+Mul element-wise pairs collapse into one fused Metal kernel per
layer.  The new `--cfm-steps N` flag exposes the standard CFM step count
(default 10); N=7 is the recommended quality knee (log-mel cosine vs N=10
= **0.995**).

| Config                              | T3 infer           | S3Gen infer | Audio | **RTF** |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------:|------------:|------:|--------:|
| MTL, Metal Q4_0, `--cfm-steps 7`    |  478 ms /  84 tok  |    576 ms   | 3.48 s|  0.30   |
| MTL, Metal Q4_0 (default N=10)      |  482 ms /  84 tok  |    730 ms   | 3.48 s|  0.35   |
| MTL, Metal F16, `--cfm-steps 7`     |  579 ms /  89 tok  |    586 ms   | 3.68 s|  0.32   |
| MTL, Metal F16 (default N=10)       |  613 ms /  89 tok  |    752 ms   | 3.68 s|  0.37   |

Compared to the M4 multilingual numbers above, the M3 Ultra hits
**RTF 0.30** on Q4_0 — a 4.6× speedup.  The CFG-batching alone drops T3
by 42–45% (see PROGRESS.md §3.21 for the full bench matrix and the
NEGATIVE results for F16 KV cache and SwiGLU on F16).

### Multilingual (M3 Ultra, post §3.24–§3.31 Metal kernel portfolio)

Same prompt, voice, seed as §3.21 above.  Adds, on top of §3.21:

- **§3.24** — HiFT conv-kernel F16 quantisation (64 tensors).
- **§3.26** — `kernel_mul_mv_f32_f16{,_4,_short}` Metal kernel variants
  to unblock 21 more HiFT `source_*` F16 tensors
  (GGUF shrinks **754 → 747 MB**, WAV cos 1.000000 vs §3.24).
- **§3.27** — `kernel_mul_mm` + `ADD(bias)` [+ `ADD(residual)`] fusion
  for the CFM transformer Q4_0 mat-muls (1820 saved `ggml_add`
  dispatches per synth).
- **§3.28** — extends the fusion to absorb `GELU_ERF` (CFM FF ff0
  activation path; 1120 additional saved dispatches).
- **§3.30** — `test-metal-ops` fused-mul_mm parity harness + bias-only
  direct-store variant.
- **§3.31** — iOS-arm64 cross-build portability +
  `scripts/bench-m4-validation.sh` for M4 hand-off.

5-invocation averages (`default N=10` CFM — compare to the §3.21 N=10 row):

| Config                              | T3 infer            | S3Gen infer | Audio | **RTF** |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------:|------------:|------:|--------:|
| MTL, Metal Q4_0 + HiFT F16 v2 (§3.28) |  433 ms / 84 tok  |    706 ms   | 3.48 s| **0.33** |
| MTL, Metal Q4_0 baseline (§3.21 N=10) |  482 ms / 84 tok  |    730 ms   | 3.48 s|  0.35    |
| **Δ §3.21 → §3.28**                   |  **−49 ms / −10.2 %** | **−24 ms / −3.3 %** | — | **−0.02** |

WAV is byte-exact deterministic across runs (md5
`d8a1b22375dbcb2259c686426a7d76c5` ×5).  Parity harness
`test-metal-ops` passes 14 gates (3 base + 3 conv_transpose_1d + 8
fused `mul_mm`).  The 1088-line ggml-metal patch backing these
kernel changes is shipped pre-applied by the `ggml-speech` vcpkg
port (qvac-ext-ggml/speech branch); the standalone chatterbox.cpp
repo carries it under `patches/ggml-metal-chatterbox-ops.patch`
against pinned ggml `58c38058`.  All §3.24–§3.30 kernel changes
cross-compile cleanly for iOS-arm64 (portability verified; runtime
measurement deferred until an M4 / iPhone / iPad run of
[`scripts/bench-m4-validation.sh`](scripts/bench-m4-validation.sh)).

M3 Ultra CFM time specifically drops from 541.9 ms → 534.0 ms
(**−1.5 %**) — modest on this chip because per-dispatch overhead
is very low; expected to be larger on bandwidth-limited silicon
(M4 / A-series) where each saved `ggml_add` dispatch is worth more
relative to compute.

### Reproducing these numbers

```bash
# Build tts-cpp, then:
./build/tts-cli \
    --model       models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
    --s3gen-gguf  models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
    --reference-audio test/reference-audio/jfk.wav \
    --text "Hello from native C plus plus. This audio was generated end to end on CPU using ggml." \
    --out /tmp/bench.wav \
    --seed 42 \
    --n-gpu-layers 99   # 0 or omit for CPU
```

The binary prints both the per-stage timings and `BENCH:` lines that
scripts can scrape.  Note: the binary also prints an inner
`=== pipeline: … RTF=… ===` line — that RTF covers **only the
S3Gen + HiFT phase** (the timer around `s3gen_synthesize_to_wav`, which
runs after T3 is already done).  The tables above report the full
end-to-end number (T3_INFER + S3GEN_INFER).

`gen_RTF = (T3_INFER_MS + S3GEN_INFER_MS) / AUDIO_MS`

Token counts vary slightly across backends because the CPU-side
sampler reads logits that come out of different float-reduction orders
per backend; per-token T3 cost is the directly-comparable figure.
Full development history and older backend combinations (F16 vs
Q4_0 / Q5_0 / Q8_0, plus other machines) are in
[`PROGRESS.md §3.10 / §3.13`](PROGRESS.md).

### Streaming mode — low-latency playback

For interactive use cases, the binary can emit audio **chunk-by-chunk**
as it's generated instead of waiting for the whole sentence to finish.
Any non-zero `--stream-chunk-tokens N` turns streaming on.

**Flags:**

- `--stream-chunk-tokens N` — main knob; N speech tokens per chunk
  (25 ≈ 1 s of audio, 50 ≈ 2 s).
- `--stream-first-chunk-tokens N` — override the *first* chunk's size
  so first-audio-out lands early while later chunks stay big and keep
  overall RTF low.  Typical: 10.
- `--stream-cfm-steps N` — CFM Euler step count. Turbo defaults to 2 and
  supports 1 or 2; one step trades some quality for lower cost.
  Multilingual uses standard CFM, and streaming requests below its model
  timestep count are floored to 10.
- `--out -` — emit raw `s16le` mono @ 24 kHz to stdout instead of
  writing a wav file, so the output can be piped straight into a
  player.

**Recommended low-latency preset for interactive use:**

```bash
brew install sox      # one-time, for the `play` command

./build/tts-cli \
    --model      models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf \
    --s3gen-gguf models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf \
    --text       "Hello from streaming Chatterbox." \
    --stream-first-chunk-tokens 10 \
    --stream-chunk-tokens       25 \
    --stream-cfm-steps          1 \
    --n-gpu-layers              99 \
    --out - \
  | play -q -t raw -r 24000 -b 16 -e signed -c 1 -
```

`play` ships with `sox` and routes straight to CoreAudio.  If you
prefer, the same stdout stream works with `ffplay -f s16le -ar 24000
-ch_layout mono -nodisp -i -` or piped through a Python
`sounddevice.play()` one-liner; on some macOS 26 builds ffplay's SDL
output is silent for raw piped audio, so `sox play` is the safest
default.

You can also drop the `--out -` to get a regular wav:

```bash
./build/tts-cli … --stream-chunk-tokens 50 --out out.wav
afplay out.wav
```

**Latency and throughput** on an Apple M4 with the Metal backend and
the preset above, feeding the sentence *"Hello from streaming
Chatterbox, I am John and I work in Google since 2010. I love to go
out with my friends, eat some pizza and also drink some wine. I also
love to travel around the world alone."* (produces 317 speech tokens,
~12.7 s of audio):

| metric | value |
|---|---|
| first-audio-out latency | **279 ms** |
| chunk 1 (10-token bootstrap) | RTF 0.99 |
| chunks 2–13 (steady-state, 25 tokens each) | **RTF 0.30 – 0.63** |
| chunk 14 (tail finalise) | RTF 1.42 |
| total wall time | 11.5 s for 12.7 s of audio |
| overall RTF | **0.90** |

The steady-state RTFs stay comfortably below 1.0, so the streamer
sustainably pushes audio faster than real-time playback consumes it.
Chunk 1 is small by design so first audio lands in ~280 ms; the final
chunk is short and relatively slow (fixed encoder/CFM overhead
amortised over only 0.4 s of audio).

For the full journal of how streaming got there — bit-exact CFM parity,
`cache_source` + `trim_fade` port, `--out -` stdout wiring, per-chunk
tuning — see [`PROGRESS.md §B1`](PROGRESS.md).

## Fixtures and static validation

The checkout includes the model-free voice-clone metric fixtures under
`test/fixtures/voiceclone/v1` and the public-domain JFK voice reference under
`test/reference-audio`. Model-dependent fixtures remain optional:

```bash
python scripts/dump-s3gen-reference.py --out artifacts/s3gen-ref
python scripts/dump-supertonic-reference.py \
  --onnx-dir /path/to/supertonic/onnx \
  --assets-dir /path/to/supertonic/assets \
  --voice-style /path/to/supertonic/assets/voice_styles/M1.json \
  --lang en --out artifacts/supertonic-ref-quick
```

For Supertonic 3, use the same existing dumper interface once per language,
pointing `--onnx-dir`, `--assets-dir`, and `--voice-style` at the v3 bundle:

```bash
python scripts/dump-supertonic-reference.py \
  --onnx-dir /path/to/supertonic-3/onnx \
  --assets-dir /path/to/supertonic-3/assets \
  --voice-style /path/to/supertonic-3/assets/voice_styles/M1.json \
  --lang en --out artifacts/supertonic3-ref-en
```

The current dumper accepts the legacy five-language `--lang` choices. Generate
`en`, `ko`, `es`, `pt`, and `fr` for the registered Supertonic 3 parity suite;
the model-free `test-supertonic-languages` target covers the complete v3
language registry.

For quantized Parler inspection, report-only mode is an environment variable
on the individual harness executable:

```bash
PARLER_TEST_REPORT_ONLY=1 ./build/test-parler-t5 MODEL.gguf REF_DIR
PARLER_TEST_REPORT_ONLY=1 ./build/test-parler-decoder MODEL.gguf REF_DIR
```

Do not treat `ctest -N` or disabled fixture registrations as executed tests.

### Optional: validate against Python references

Every stage of the pipeline has a numerical regression test against
Python-dumped reference tensors:

```bash
./build/test-s3gen models/chatterbox-s3gen.gguf artifacts/s3gen-ref ALL
```

Expected output (rel error per stage):

```
Stage A  speaker_emb_affine    rel ≈ 1e-7
Stage B  input_embedded        rel = 0
Stage C  encoder_embed         rel ≈ 4e-7
Stage D  pre_lookahead         rel ≈ 3e-7
Stage E  enc_block0_out        rel ≈ 1e-7
Stage F  encoder_proj (mu)     rel ≈ 5e-7
Stage G1 time_mixer            rel ≈ 7e-7
Stage G2 cfm_resnet_out        rel ≈ 3e-7
Stage G3 tfm_out               rel ≈ 2e-7
Stage G4 cfm_step0_dxdt        rel ≈ 1e-6
Stage H1 f0                    rel ≈ 4e-6
Stage H3 conv_post             rel ≈ 6e-7
Stage H4 stft                  rel ≈ 8e-3 (boundary-bound)
Stage H5 waveform              rel ≈ 1e-4
```

For T3 bit-exact validation against the Python reference:

```bash
python scripts/reference-t3-turbo.py \
  --text "Hello from ggml." \
  --out-dir artifacts \
  --cpp-bin ./build/tts-cli \
  --cpp-model models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf
```

## Troubleshooting

**`TTS_CPP_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=OFF` reports a missing `engines/tts/ggml`** — run
`bash engines/tts/scripts/setup-ggml.sh` to stage the pinned
`qvac-ext-ggml@speech` checkout there, or install `ggml-speech`, set
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` or use the vcpkg toolchain, and leave the option enabled.

**A CLI is not under `build/`** — umbrella builds place it under
`build/engines/tts/`. Visual Studio builds add the selected configuration
directory, for example `engines\tts\build\Release\audio8-cli.exe`.

**CTest cannot find a Release executable on Windows** — pass `-C Release` to
CTest when the generator is multi-config.

**Supertonic streaming flags fail in `tts-cli`** — this is intentional. Use
`supertonic-cli`; the umbrella dispatcher supports only batch Supertonic.

**Parler `--greedy` warns and still samples** — argmax does not reach a
terminating sequence for this architecture. Keep sampling and set `--seed` for
reproducible runs.

**CosyVoice3 callback chunks arrive only after generation** — the callback
currently slices completed PCM. It does not provide incremental
first-audio latency.

**A fixture-backed test is disabled** — configure output names each missing
GGUF, WAV, or reference directory. Set `TTS_CPP_TEST_MODEL_DIR`,
`TTS_CPP_TEST_AUDIO_DIR`, and `TTS_CPP_TEST_REF_DIR` to populated roots, then
reconfigure. `ctest -N` lists registrations but does not execute them.

**`error: this GGUF has no embedded tokenizer`** — you're running against
a legacy T3 GGUF built before the tokenizer was embedded. Re-run the
converter to produce a fresh GGUF:

```bash
python scripts/convert-t3-turbo-to-gguf.py --out models/chatterbox-t3-turbo.gguf
```

**`warning: s3gen GGUF lacks variant keys`** — you're running against a
legacy S3Gen GGUF produced before the variant metadata was added in
§3.19/§3.20. The defaults (`meanflow=true, n_timesteps=2, cfg_rate=0`)
match the historical Turbo behaviour, so legacy Turbo GGUFs continue
to work.  For a Multilingual S3Gen GGUF, however, those defaults are
wrong and the output will be garbage — re-run the converter:

```bash
python scripts/convert-s3gen-to-gguf.py --variant mtl --out models/chatterbox-s3gen-mtl.gguf
```

**`error: --min-p must be in [0, 1]`** / `--cfg-weight must be >= 0` /
`--exaggeration must be in [0, 1]` — the MTL sampling knobs reject
out-of-range values up front instead of producing wrong-but-not-crashing
output.  Pass values inside the documented ranges (see "Run" above).

**`--debug requires --ref-dir`** — debug mode substitutes Python-dumped
random bits to make every intermediate tensor bit-exactly comparable.
Run `python scripts/dump-s3gen-reference.py --out artifacts/s3gen-ref …`
first, then pass `--ref-dir artifacts/s3gen-ref`.

**Output is much louder than the Python reference** — expected: the Python
reference dump uses a very short utterance (mostly silence). Generate a
longer sentence and compare RMS. Differences up to ~2.5 % in spectrogram
magnitude are from the stochastic SineGen excitation (non-bit-exact RNG
between `std::mt19937` and `torch.rand`).

**Slower than real-time** — make sure you built a Release configuration,
requested an available backend, and selected an appropriate `--threads` value.
Most TTS CLI and engine defaults cap automatic CPU threads at 4 because these
graphs can regress under oversubscription; more threads are not automatically
faster.
