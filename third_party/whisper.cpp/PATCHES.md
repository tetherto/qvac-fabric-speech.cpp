# QVAC patches on vendored whisper.cpp

This directory is a **git subtree** of [ggml-org/whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp),
currently pinned at **v1.9.1** (`f049fff9`; machine-readable pin in
`UPSTREAM_PIN`, consumed by the divergence-guard CI). It is *upstream-tracking,
minimally divergent*: the only files that may differ from the pinned upstream
tag are the ones listed below. CI enforces this (divergence-guard job) —
if you change anything in this directory, either it's an upstream sync
(`git subtree pull`, see `docs/UPSTREAM-SYNC.md`) or this manifest must be
updated in the same PR.

**ggml is special:** `ggml/` in this subtree must stay byte-identical to
upstream. All QVAC ggml patches live in
[`qvac-ext-ggml`](https://github.com/tetherto/qvac-ext-ggml) (`speech` branch),
which ships as the `ggml-speech` vcpkg port; the umbrella build forces
`WHISPER_USE_SYSTEM_GGML=ON`, so the vendored `ggml/` is never compiled.

## Manifest

Each row must be self-contained: state what the change does and why it
exists, so the manifest is meaningful without access to any tracker.

| File | Change | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `src/whisper.cpp` | vocab-logits slice + decoder QKV matmul fusion | decode-time perf on mobile GPUs (quantized decode on Adreno-class hardware): the vocab-logits matmul is sliced to only the rows sampling actually needs instead of the full vocab, and the decoder's three Q/K/V matmuls are fused into one — upstream does neither |
| `src/whisper.cpp` | VAD honors `use_gpu` | upstream places the VAD weights per `use_gpu` but forces the compute backends to CPU, so `use_gpu=true` aborts in ggml_backend_sched on every GPU build (ggml-org/whisper.cpp#3508); the backends now follow the same flag, and the LSTM input is made contiguous before its matmul because the CUDA mul-mat-vec kernel rejects the odd-stride transposed view. Default stays CPU. Upstreaming candidate |
| `src/whisper.cpp`, `include/whisper.h` | memory-fit preflight (`whisper_fit_params` / `whisper_fit_actual`) | project whether a model + workload fits the free device memory WITHOUT reading weight data (QVAC-24283, the SDK's @qvac/model-fit contract: Success=0/Failure=1/Error=2). The projection mirrors the runtime by construction: `whisper_model_load`, `whisper_kv_cache_init` and the VAD init gain an optional measure mode (size buffers via ggml's size-only APIs, seek past tensor payloads, mark tensors externally-allocated), and a size-only twin of `whisper_init_state` prices the four resident schedulers through `ggml_backend_sched_reserve_size`. `whisper_fit_actual` measures the same breakdown from a real load, reproducing `whisper_full`'s worst-case KV recreation when `n_decoders > 1` -- the byte-parity oracle for the tests |
| `examples/whisper-fit-params/` | new example (`whisper-fit-params` CLI + `whisper-fit-util.h`) | thin front-end over `whisper_fit_params`: exit code == fit status, `--json` for the SDK, `--verify` prints projected-vs-real; the header keeps the strict ERANGE-checked parsers and UTF-8-validating JSON escaper testable model-free |
| `examples/CMakeLists.txt` | register `whisper-fit-params` | build glue for the example above |
| `tests/test-whisper-fit-cli.cpp` | new file | model-free unit test: strict numeric parsers, saturating margin arithmetic, JSON escaping, and `whisper_fit_params`' invalid-argument / missing-model status contract |
| `tests/test-whisper-fit-params.cpp` | new file | byte-parity gates: a metadata-only projection must equal what a real load + state init actually allocates (weights, KV caches, all four scheduler compute buffers, VAD, host-overflow split), byte-for-byte including the `n_decoders > 1` KV worst case, and longer audio must grow only host bytes; the `gpu` arm additionally anchors the device/host classifier to the driver's own allocation counter (parity alone cannot see a misclassification shared by both sides) and exits 77 (ctest SKIP) without a GPU device; runs against the committed tiny + silero fixtures |
| `tests/CMakeLists.txt` | register the two fit tests | the model-free/CPU forms carry the `unit` label and use only committed fixtures, so they run model-download-free in CI; the parity test is registered a second time as `test-whisper-fit-params-gpu` under the `gpu` label -- excluded by the CPU lanes' `-LE 'gpu|...'`, picked up by any `ctest -L gpu` GPU lane (the engines' self-hosted-lane convention), and a ctest SKIP where no GPU exists |
| `src/whisper-logits-slice.h` | new file | helper implementing the vocab-logits slice above |
| `include/whisper.h` | API additions | public controls for the logits-slice behavior so bindings/addons can opt in per-decode |
| `src/CMakeLists.txt` | build glue | wire whisper-logits-slice.h; install/export adjustments for the vcpkg port |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | install/export + robustness | export `whisper-targets`, headers under `include/whisper/`; guard `git-vars`/js-bindings config steps so source-tarball (vcpkg) builds work |
| `cmake/git-vars.cmake` | robustness | tolerate non-git source trees (vcpkg tarballs) |
| `cmake/whisper-config.cmake.in` | config fixes | correct find_package config for system-ggml consumers |
| `CMakeLists.txt`, `src/CMakeLists.txt`, `examples/CMakeLists.txt` | `WHISPER_BUILD_PARAKEET` option (default ON) | gate upstream's bundled parakeet: its `parakeet`/`parakeet-cli` target names collide with `engines/parakeet`; the umbrella sets it OFF. Upstreaming candidate |
| `CMakeLists.txt` | `include(GNUInstallDirs)` moved before `add_subdirectory(src)` | the whisper INSTALL_INTERFACE expands `${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}`; unset it exports a bogus `/whisper` path breaking install-tree `find_package(whisper)`. Absorbed from the registry port's patch. Upstreaming candidate |
| `tests/test-whisper-logits-slice.cpp` | new file | header-only unit test for the vocab-logits slice patch (suffix-offset arithmetic); needs no model |
| `tests/test-vad-streaming.cpp` | new file | pins the streaming-VAD contract: `whisper_vad_detect_speech_no_reset` + `whisper_vad_reset_state` must reproduce `whisper_vad_detect_speech` per-chunk probabilities exactly; uses only the committed silero test fixture |
| `tests/test-whisper-lang.cpp` | new file | pins the `whisper_lang_*` lookup API (code/full-name round-trip over all 100 entries, unknown-input handling) — the multilingual surface every `-l` / `--detect-language` option resolves through; needs no model |
| `tests/test-whisper-params.cpp` | new file | pins the default-parameter contract (`whisper_full_default_params` greedy/beam, context, VAD, `_by_ref`) so an upstream sync cannot silently change decode defaults; needs no model |
| `tests/test-vad-gpu.cpp` | new file | pins the VAD `use_gpu=true` contract for the fix above: init must succeed and produce CPU-matching probabilities; exercises the real GPU path on GPU builds and degrades to CPU-vs-CPU elsewhere; uses only the committed silero test fixture |
| `tests/CMakeLists.txt` | register the five tests above; gate the parakeet tests behind `WHISPER_BUILD_PARAKEET` | the new tests carry `unit` labels so they run model-free in CI; the upstream parakeet tests link the gated `parakeet` target and must follow its option |
| `bindings/java/src/main/java/io/github/ggerganov/whispercpp/params/WhisperFullParams.java`, `bindings/java/src/main/java/io/github/ggerganov/whispercpp/params/WhisperVadParams.java` | VAD parameters exposed to the Java binding | keeps the Java surface in step with the VAD options in whisper_full_params |
| `examples/addon.node/package.json` | cmake-js `^7.1.1` → `^8.0.0` + npm `overrides` pinning transitive `tar` to `^7.5.21` | security: cmake-js 7.x depends on `tar ^6.2.0`, vulnerable to a decompression/parse DoS via unlimited input (GHSA-23hp-3jrh-7fpw) and further criticals fixed only in tar >= 7.5.21; the override guarantees a safe resolution since the example ships no lockfile. Upstreaming candidate |

**Deliberately dropped from the pre-subtree fork** (not upstream, not restored):
`examples/talk-llama/llama-hparams.{h,cpp}` carried a stray `kv_only_nextn`
MTP-head hunk referencing `nextn_predict_layers`, which does not exist in
the talk-llama snapshot upstream ships with v1.9.1 — it did not compile and
was the cause of the `ubuntu-22-*` failures in the (now inert) upstream
`build.yml` on every master push. The demo builds clean without it.

Marker convention: new QVAC code blocks carry a `QVAC` reference in a nearby
comment where practical.

## Updating this pin

See `docs/UPSTREAM-SYNC.md`. Short version: `git subtree pull
--prefix third_party/whisper.cpp upstream <tag> --squash`, resolve conflicts
(expected only in the files above), re-verify this manifest, run the full CI
matrix.
